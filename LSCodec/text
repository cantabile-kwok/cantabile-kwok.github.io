1089_134686_000001_000001 He hoped there would be stew for dinner, turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in thick peppered flour fattened sauce. Stuff it into you, his belly counselled him.
1089_134686_000002_000000 It would be a gloomy secret night.
1089_134686_000002_000001 After early nightfall the yellow lamps would light up, here and there, the squalid quarter of the brothels.
1089_134686_000002_000002 He would follow a devious course up and down the streets, circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear and joy, until his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner.
1089_134686_000002_000003 The whores would be just coming out of their houses making ready for the night, yawning lazily after their sleep and settling the hairpins in their clusters of hair. He would pass by them calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own will or a sudden call to his sin loving soul from their soft perfumed flesh.
1089_134686_000002_000004 Yet as he prowled in quest of that call, his senses, stultified only by his desire, would note keenly all that wounded or shamed them; his eyes, a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a photograph of two soldiers standing to attention or a gaudy playbill; his ears, the drawling jargon of greeting:
1089_134686_000003_000000 --Hello, Bertie, any good in your mind?
1089_134686_000004_000000 --Is that you, pigeon?
1089_134686_000005_000000 --Number ten.
1089_134686_000005_000001 Fresh Nelly is waiting on you.
1089_134686_000006_000000 --Good night, husband!
1089_134686_000006_000001 Coming in to have a short time?
1089_134686_000007_000000 The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread out a widening tail, eyed and starred like a peacock's; and, when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated, began slowly to fold itself together again.
1089_134686_000007_000002 The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary mind outward to its verge and inward to its centre, a distant music accompanying him outward and inward.
1089_134686_000007_000003 What music?
1089_134686_000007_000004 The music came nearer and he recalled the words, the words of Shelley's fragment upon the moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness.
1089_134686_000007_000005 The stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell through space.
1089_134686_000008_000000 The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail. It was his own soul going forth to experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading abroad the bale fire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself, fading slowly, quenching its own lights and fires. They were quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos.
1089_134686_000009_000000 A cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul.
1089_134686_000009_000001 At his first violent sin he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and had feared to find his body or his soul maimed by the excess.
1089_134686_000009_000002 Instead the vital wave had carried him on its bosom out of himself and back again when it receded: and no part of body or soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been established between them.
1089_134686_000009_000003 The chaos in which his ardour extinguished itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself.
1089_134686_000009_000004 He had sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew that, while he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the first sin alone, by every succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his punishment.
1089_134686_000009_000005 His days and works and thoughts could make no atonement for him, the fountains of sanctifying grace having ceased to refresh his soul.
1089_134686_000009_000006 At most, by an alms given to a beggar whose blessing he fled from, he might hope wearily to win for himself some measure of actual grace.
1089_134686_000009_000007 Devotion had gone by the board.
1089_134686_000009_000008 What did it avail to pray when he knew that his soul lusted after its own destruction?
1089_134686_000009_000009 A certain pride, a certain awe, withheld him from offering to God even one prayer at night, though he knew it was in God's power to take away his life while he slept and hurl his soul hellward ere he could beg for mercy.
1089_134686_000009_000010 His pride in his own sin, his loveless awe of God, told him that his offence was too grievous to be atoned for in whole or in part by a false homage to the All seeing and All knowing.
1089_134686_000010_000000 --Well now, Ennis, I declare you have a head and so has my stick!
1089_134686_000010_000001 Do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what a surd is?
1089_134686_000011_000001 Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear.
1089_134686_000011_000002 On Sunday mornings as he passed the church door he glanced coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded, four deep, outside the church, morally present at the mass which they could neither see nor hear. Their dull piety and the sickly smell of the cheap hair oil with which they had anointed their heads repelled him from the altar they prayed at.
1089_134686_000011_000003 He stooped to the evil of hypocrisy with others, sceptical of their innocence which he could cajole so easily.
1089_134686_000012_000000 On the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll, the certificate of his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
1089_134686_000012_000002 The falsehood of his position did not pain him.
1089_134686_000012_000003 If at moments he felt an impulse to rise from his post of honour and, confessing before them all his unworthiness, to leave the chapel, a glance at their faces restrained him.
1089_134686_000012_000004 The imagery of the psalms of prophecy soothed his barren pride.
1089_134686_000014_000001 Her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity; her holiness, a strange light glowing faintly upon her frail flesh, did not humiliate the sinner who approached her.
1089_134686_000014_000002 If ever he was impelled to cast sin from him and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be her knight.
1089_134686_000014_000003 If ever his soul, re entering her dwelling shyly after the frenzy of his body's lust had spent itself, was turned towards her whose emblem is the morning star, BRIGHT AND MUSICAL, TELLING OF HEAVEN AND INFUSING PEACE, it was when her names were murmured softly by lips whereon there still lingered foul and shameful words, the savour itself of a lewd kiss.
1089_134686_000015_000000 That was strange.
1089_134686_000015_000001 He tried to think how it could be.
1089_134686_000015_000002 But the dusk, deepening in the schoolroom, covered over his thoughts.
1089_134686_000015_000003 The bell rang. The master marked the sums and cuts to be done for the next lesson and went out.
1089_134686_000015_000004 Heron, beside Stephen, began to hum tunelessly.
1089_134686_000017_000000 Ennis, who had gone to the yard, came back, saying:
1089_134686_000018_000000 --The boy from the house is coming up for the rector.
1089_134686_000019_000000 A tall boy behind Stephen rubbed his hands and said:
1089_134686_000020_000000 --That's game ball.
1089_134686_000020_000001 We can scut the whole hour.
1089_134686_000021_000000 Stephen, leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler, listened to the talk about him which Heron checked from time to time by saying:
1089_134686_000022_000000 --Shut up, will you.
1089_134686_000022_000001 Don't make such a bally racket!
1089_134686_000023_000000 It was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in following up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating into obscure silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his own condemnation.
1089_134686_000023_000001 The sentence of saint james which says that he who offends against one commandment becomes guilty of all, had seemed to him first a swollen phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own state.
1089_134686_000024_000000 As he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rector's shrewd harsh face, his mind wound itself in and out of the curious questions proposed to it.
1089_134686_000024_000001 If a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest accruing upon it or all his huge fortune?
1089_134686_000024_000002 If a layman in giving baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child baptized?
1089_134686_000024_000004 How comes it that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also to the meek that they shall possess the land?
1089_134686_000024_000005 Why was the sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and wine if Jesus Christ be present body and blood, soul and divinity, in the bread alone and in the wine alone?
1089_134686_000024_000006 Does a tiny particle of the consecrated bread contain all the body and blood of Jesus Christ or a part only of the body and blood?
1089_134686_000024_000007 If the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble into corruption after they have been consecrated, is Jesus Christ still present under their species as God and as man?
1089_134686_000025_000001 Here he is!
1089_134686_000026_000000 A boy from his post at the window had seen the rector come from the house.
1089_134686_000026_000001 All the catechisms were opened and all heads bent upon them silently.
1089_134686_000026_000003 A gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged Stephen to ask a difficult question.
1089_134686_000027_000000 The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from.
1089_134686_000027_000001 He clasped his hands on the desk and said:
1089_134686_000028_000001 The retreat will go on from Wednesday to Friday.
1089_134686_000028_000002 On Friday confession will be heard all the afternoon after beads.
1089_134686_000028_000003 If any boys have special confessors perhaps it will be better for them not to change.
1089_134686_000028_000004 Mass will be on Saturday morning at nine o'clock and general communion for the whole college.
1089_134686_000028_000006 But Saturday and Sunday being free days some boys might be inclined to think that Monday is a free day also.
1089_134686_000028_000007 Beware of making that mistake.
1089_134686_000028_000008 I think you, Lawless, are likely to make that mistake.
1089_134686_000029_000000 --I sir?
1089_134686_000029_000001 Why, sir?
1089_134686_000030_000000 A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of boys from the rector's grim smile.
1089_134686_000030_000001 Stephen's heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower.
1089_134686_000031_000000 The rector went on gravely:
1089_134686_000032_000000 --You are all familiar with the story of the life of saint Francis Xavier, I suppose, the patron of your college.
1089_134686_000032_000001 He came of an old and illustrious Spanish family and you remember that he was one of the first followers of saint Ignatius.
1089_134686_000032_000004 He is called, as you know, the apostle of the Indies.
1089_134686_000032_000005 He went from country to country in the east, from Africa to India, from India to Japan, baptizing the people.
1089_134686_000032_000006 He is said to have baptized as many as ten thousand idolaters in one month.
1089_134686_000032_000007 It is said that his right arm had grown powerless from having been raised so often over the heads of those whom he baptized. He wished then to go to China to win still more souls for God but he died of fever on the island of Sancian.
1089_134686_000032_000008 A great saint, saint Francis Xavier!
1089_134686_000032_000009 A great soldier of God!
1089_134686_000034_000000 --He had the faith in him that moves mountains.
1089_134686_000034_000001 Ten thousand souls won for God in a single month!
1089_134686_000034_000003 A saint who has great power in heaven, remember: power to intercede for us in our grief; power to obtain whatever we pray for if it be for the good of our souls; power above all to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin.
1089_134686_000034_000004 A great saint, saint Francis Xavier!
1089_134686_000034_000005 A great fisher of souls!
1089_134686_000035_000000 He ceased to shake his clasped hands and, resting them against his forehead, looked right and left of them keenly at his listeners out of his dark stern eyes.
1089_134691_000001_000000 He could wait no longer.
1089_134691_000002_000001 A full hour had passed since his father had gone in with Dan Crosby, the tutor, to find out for him something about the university.
1089_134691_000002_000002 For a full hour he had paced up and down, waiting: but he could wait no longer.
1089_134691_000003_000000 He set off abruptly for the Bull, walking rapidly lest his father's shrill whistle might call him back; and in a few moments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was safe.
1089_134691_000004_000000 Yes, his mother was hostile to the idea, as he had read from her listless silence.
1089_134691_000004_000001 Yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly than his father's pride and he thought coldly how he had watched the faith which was fading down in his soul ageing and strengthening in her eyes.
1089_134691_000004_000002 A dim antagonism gathered force within him and darkened his mind as a cloud against her disloyalty and when it passed, cloud like, leaving his mind serene and dutiful towards her again, he was made aware dimly and without regret of a first noiseless sundering of their lives.
1089_134691_000005_000000 The university!
1089_134691_000005_000003 The end he had been born to serve yet did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path and now it beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was about to be opened to him.
1089_134691_000005_000005 It was an elfin prelude, endless and formless; and, as it grew wilder and faster, the flames leaping out of time, he seemed to hear from under the boughs and grasses wild creatures racing, their feet pattering like rain upon the leaves.
1089_134691_000005_000006 Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind, the feet of hares and rabbits, the feet of harts and hinds and antelopes, until he heard them no more and remembered only a proud cadence from Newman:
1089_134691_000006_000000 --Whose feet are as the feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms.
1089_134691_000007_000000 The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused.
1089_134691_000007_000001 All through his boyhood he had mused upon that which he had so often thought to be his destiny and when the moment had come for him to obey the call he had turned aside, obeying a wayward instinct.
1089_134691_000008_000000 He turned seaward from the road at Dollymount and as he passed on to the thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking with the tramp of heavily shod feet.
1089_134691_000008_000001 A squad of christian brothers was on its way back from the Bull and had begun to pass, two by two, across the bridge. Soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding.
1089_134691_000008_000003 Angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their top heavy silk hats and humble tape like collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes.
1089_134691_000010_000000 Their piety would be like their names, like their faces, like their clothes, and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts, it might be, paid a far richer tribute of devotion than his had ever been, a gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration.
1089_134691_000010_000001 It was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them, to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates, stripped of his pride, beaten and in beggar's weeds, that they would be generous towards him, loving him as themselves.
1089_134691_000010_000002 Idle and embittering, finally, to argue, against his own dispassionate certitude, that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love.
1089_134691_000011_000000 He drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly to himself:
1089_134691_000013_000001 Words.
1089_134691_000013_000002 Was it their colours?
1089_134691_000013_000003 He allowed them to glow and fade, hue after hue: sunrise gold, the russet and green of apple orchards, azure of waves, the grey fringed fleece of clouds.
1089_134691_000013_000004 No, it was not their colours: it was the poise and balance of the period itself.
1089_134691_000014_000000 He passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again.
1089_134691_000014_000001 At that instant, as it seemed to him, the air was chilled and, looking askance towards the water, he saw a flying squall darkening and crisping suddenly the tide.
1089_134691_000014_000002 A faint click at his heart, a faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his flesh dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea; yet he did not strike across the downs on his left but held straight on along the spine of rocks that pointed against the river's mouth.
1089_134691_000015_000000 A veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where the river was embayed.
1089_134691_000015_000001 In the distance along the course of the slow flowing Liffey slender masts flecked the sky and, more distant still, the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze.
1089_134691_000015_000002 Like a scene on some vague arras, old as man's weariness, the image of the seventh city of christendom was visible to him across the timeless air, no older nor more weary nor less patient of subjection than in the days of the thingmote.
1089_134691_000016_000000 Disheartened, he raised his eyes towards the slow drifting clouds, dappled and seaborne.
1089_134691_000016_000001 They were voyaging across the deserts of the sky, a host of nomads on the march, voyaging high over Ireland, westward bound.
1089_134691_000016_000002 The Europe they had come from lay out there beyond the Irish Sea, Europe of strange tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled and of entrenched and marshalled races.
1089_134691_000020_000000 --Good man, Towser!
1089_134691_000020_000001 Duck him!
1089_134691_000021_000000 --Come along, Dedalus!
1089_134691_000022_000000 --Duck him!
1089_134691_000022_000001 Guzzle him now, Towser!
1089_134691_000023_000000 --Help!
1089_134691_000023_000001 Help!...
1089_134691_000024_000000 He recognized their speech collectively before he distinguished their faces.
1089_134691_000024_000001 The mere sight of that medley of wet nakedness chilled him to the bone.
1089_134691_000024_000002 Their bodies, corpse white or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the sun, gleamed with the wet of the sea. Their diving stone, poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges, and the rough hewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horseplay gleamed with cold wet lustre.
1089_134691_000024_000003 The towels with which they smacked their bodies were heavy with cold seawater; and drenched with cold brine was their matted hair.
1089_134691_000025_000000 He stood still in deference to their calls and parried their banter with easy words.
1089_134691_000025_000001 How characterless they looked: Shuley without his deep unbuttoned collar, Ennis without his scarlet belt with the snaky clasp, and Connolly without his Norfolk coat with the flapless side pockets! It was a pain to see them, and a sword like pain to see the signs of adolescence that made repellent their pitiable nakedness.
1089_134691_000025_000002 Perhaps they had taken refuge in number and noise from the secret dread in their souls.
1089_134691_000025_000003 But he, apart from them and in silence, remembered in what dread he stood of the mystery of his own body.
1089_134691_000026_000000 --Stephanos Dedalos!
1089_134691_000026_000002 Bous Stephaneforos!
1089_134691_000027_000000 Their banter was not new to him and now it flattered his mild proud sovereignty.
1089_134691_000027_000001 Now, as never before, his strange name seemed to him a prophecy.
1089_134691_000027_000002 So timeless seemed the grey warm air, so fluid and impersonal his own mood, that all ages were as one to him.
1089_134691_000027_000003 A moment before the ghost of the ancient kingdom of the Danes had looked forth through the vesture of the hazewrapped City.
1089_134691_000027_000004 Now, at the name of the fabulous artificer, he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves and to see a winged form flying above the waves and slowly climbing the air.
1089_134691_000027_000005 What did it mean?
1089_134691_000027_000006 Was it a quaint device opening a page of some medieval book of prophecies and symbols, a hawk like man flying sunward above the sea, a prophecy of the end he had been born to serve and had been following through the mists of childhood and boyhood, a symbol of the artist forging anew in his workshop out of the sluggish matter of the earth a new soaring impalpable imperishable being?
1089_134691_000028_000001 His heart trembled in an ecstasy of fear and his soul was in flight.
1089_134691_000028_000003 An ecstasy of flight made radiant his eyes and wild his breath and tremulous and wild and radiant his windswept limbs.
1089_134691_000029_000000 --One!
1089_134691_000029_000002 Look out!
1089_134691_000031_000000 --One!
1089_134691_000033_000000 --One!...
1089_134691_000035_000000 His throat ached with a desire to cry aloud, the cry of a hawk or eagle on high, to cry piercingly of his deliverance to the winds.
1089_134691_000035_000001 This was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross voice of the world of duties and despair, not the inhuman voice that had called him to the pale service of the altar.
1089_134691_000035_000002 An instant of wild flight had delivered him and the cry of triumph which his lips withheld cleft his brain.
1089_134691_000037_000000 What were they now but cerements shaken from the body of death-the fear he had walked in night and day, the incertitude that had ringed him round, the shame that had abased him within and without-cerements, the linens of the grave?
1089_134691_000038_000000 His soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood, spurning her grave clothes.
1089_134691_000038_000004 He would create proudly out of the freedom and power of his soul, as the great artificer whose name he bore, a living thing, new and soaring and beautiful, impalpable, imperishable.
1089_134691_000039_000000 He started up nervously from the stone block for he could no longer quench the flame in his blood.
1089_134691_000039_000001 He felt his cheeks aflame and his throat throbbing with song.
1089_134691_000040_000000 He looked northward towards Howth.
1089_134691_000042_000001 Emerald and black and russet and olive, it moved beneath the current, swaying and turning.
1089_134691_000042_000002 The water of the rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the high drifting clouds.
1089_134691_000042_000003 The clouds were drifting above him silently and silently the seatangle was drifting below him and the grey warm air was still and a new wild life was singing in his veins.
1089_134691_000043_000000 Where was his boyhood now?
1089_134691_000044_000001 He was unheeded, happy and near to the wild heart of life.
1089_134691_000045_000003 Her thighs, fuller and soft hued as ivory, were bared almost to the hips, where the white fringes of her drawers were like feathering of soft white down.
1089_134691_000045_000004 Her slate blue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her.
1089_134691_000045_000005 Her bosom was as a bird's, soft and slight, slight and soft as the breast of some dark plumaged dove.
1089_134691_000045_000006 But her long fair hair was girlish: and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal beauty, her face.
1089_134691_000046_000000 She was alone and still, gazing out to sea; and when she felt his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him in quiet sufferance of his gaze, without shame or wantonness.
1089_134691_000047_000000 --Heavenly God! cried Stephen's soul, in an outburst of profane joy.
1089_134691_000048_000000 He turned away from her suddenly and set off across the strand.
1089_134691_000049_000001 Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call.
1089_134691_000049_000002 To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!
1089_134691_000049_000003 A wild angel had appeared to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy from the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory.
1089_134691_000050_000002 What hour was it?
1089_134691_000052_000000 He felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm processes of the heavenly bodies; and the earth beneath him, the earth that had borne him, had taken him to her breast.
1089_134691_000053_000001 His eyelids trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth and her watchers, trembled as if they felt the strange light of some new world.
1089_134691_000053_000002 His soul was swooning into some new world, fantastic, dim, uncertain as under sea, traversed by cloudy shapes and beings.
1089_134691_000053_000003 A world, a glimmer or a flower?
1089_134691_000054_000000 Evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid grasses of his bed glowed no longer.
1089_134691_000055_000000 He climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about him.
1188_133604_000000_000000 three.
1188_133604_000004_000005 You see how doubly, how intimately, opposed the ideas are; yet how difficult to explain without apparent contradiction.
1188_133604_000006_000000 So that the schools of Crystal, visionary, passionate, and fantastic in purpose, are, in method, trenchantly formal and clear; and the schools of Clay, absolutely realistic, temperate, and simple in purpose, are, in method, mysterious and soft; sometimes licentious, sometimes terrific, and always obscure.
1188_133604_000011_000002 By being studious of color they are studious of division; and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing-unseparated light, the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light.
1188_133604_000011_000003 And therefore, primarily, they must be able to divide; so that elementary exercises in color must be directed, like first exercises in music, to the clear separation of notes; and the final perfections of color are those in which, of innumerable notes or hues, every one has a distinct office, and can be fastened on by the eye, and approved, as fulfilling it.
1188_133604_000012_000002 My first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance, on any student who might attempt to copy them, this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side.
1188_133604_000012_000003 Some of the touches, indeed, when the tint has been mixed with much water, have been laid in little drops or ponds, so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge.
1188_133604_000012_000004 And one of the chief delights which any one who really enjoys painting finds in that art as distinct from sculpture is in this exquisite inlaying or joiner's work of it, the fitting of edge to edge with a manual skill precisely correspondent to the close application of crowded notes without the least slur, in fine harp or piano playing.
1188_133604_000018_000000 Then he comes to the beak of it.
1188_133604_000018_000001 The brown ground beneath is left, for the most part; one touch of black is put for the hollow; two delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve; and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible.
1188_133604_000018_000002 There are just four touches-fine as the finest penmanship-to do that beak; and yet you will find that in the peculiar paroquettish mumbling and nibbling action of it, and all the character in which this nibbling beak differs from the tearing beak of the eagle, it is impossible to go farther or be more precise.
1188_133604_000021_000003 Of course, I cannot do so myself; yet in these sketches of mine, made for the sake of color, there is enough to show you the nature and the value of the method. They are two pieces of study of the color of marble architecture, the tints literally "edified," and laid edge to edge as simply on the paper as the stones are on the walls.
1188_133604_000023_000000 Again, there is not a touch of black in any shadow, however deep, of these two studies; so that, if I chose to put a piece of black near them, it would be conspicuous with a vengeance.
1188_133604_000024_000000 But in this vignette, copied from Turner, you have the two principles brought out perfectly.
1188_133604_000024_000001 You have the white of foaming water, of buildings and clouds, brought out brilliantly from a white ground; and though part of the subject is in deep shadow the eye at once catches the one black point admitted in front.
1188_133604_000026_000001 I say, "whether color be gay or sad."
1188_133604_000028_000003 George" of Carpaccio at Venice, are all that I can name myself of great works.
1188_133604_000028_000004 But there exist some exquisite, though feebler, designs in missal painting; of which, in England, the landscape and flowers in the Psalter of Henry the Sixth will serve you for a sufficient type; the landscape in the Grimani missal at Venice being monumentally typical and perfect.
1188_133604_000030_000001 Now for your own practice in this, having first acquired the skill of exquisite delineation and laying of pure color, day by day you must draw some lovely natural form or flower or animal without obscurity-as in missal painting; choosing for study, in natural scenes, only what is beautiful and strong in life.
1188_133604_000031_000001 I fully anticipated, at the beginning of the Pre Raphaelite movement, that they would have carried forward this method of work; but they broke themselves to pieces by pursuing dramatic sensation instead of beauty.
1188_133604_000033_000000 Do not, therefore, think that the Gothic school is an easy one.
1188_133604_000033_000001 You might more easily fill a house with pictures like Constable's from garret to cellar, than imitate one cluster of leaves by Van Eyck or Giotto; and among all the efforts that have been made to paint our common wild flowers, I have only once-and that in this very year, just in time to show it to you-seen the thing done rightly.
1188_133604_000036_000004 Our uneducated men work too bluntly to be ever in the right; but the Germans draw finely and resolutely wrong.
1188_133604_000038_000003 But this peacock, being drawn with intense delight in blue, on gold, and getting character of peacock in the general sharp outline, instead of-as Rubens' peacocks-in black shadow, is distinctively Gothic of fine style.
1188_133604_000039_000001 I wish you therefore to begin your study of natural history and landscape by discerning the simple outlines and the pleasant colors of things; and to rest in them as long as you can.
1188_133604_000039_000002 But, observe, you can only do this on one condition-that of striving also to create, in reality, the beauty which you seek in imagination.
1188_133604_000039_000004 None of this bright Gothic art was ever done but either by faith in the attainableness of felicity in heaven, or under conditions of real order and delicate loveliness on the earth.
1188_133604_000040_000002 But if you go on into the veracities of the school of Clay, you will find there is something at the roots of almond and apple trees, which is-This.
1188_133604_000040_000003 You must look at him in the face-fight him-conquer him with what scathe you may: you need not think to keep out of the way of him.
1188_133604_000042_000001 But look here at Carpaccio, even in my copy.
1188_133604_000042_000003 And also, Carpaccio does it with a touch, with one sweep of his brush; three minutes at the most allowed for all the beast; while Michael Angelo has been haggling at this dragon's neck for an hour.
1188_133604_000045_000000 Nothing will be more precious to you, I think, in the practical study of art, than the conviction, which will force itself on you more and more every hour, of the way all things are bound together, little and great, in spirit and in matter.
1188_133604_000045_000001 So that if you get once the right clue to any group of them, it will grasp the simplest, yet reach to the highest truths.
1188_133604_000046_000003 Well, then, last, here is Turner's; Greek school of the highest class; and you define his art, absolutely, as first the displaying intensely, and with the sternest intellect, of natural form as it is, and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire.
1188_133604_000046_000004 Only, there are two sorts of cloud and fire.
1188_133604_000046_000005 He knows them both.
1188_133604_000048_000000 Now in this of Burne Jones, the landscape is clearly full of light everywhere, color or glass light: that is, the outline is prepared for modification of color only.
1188_133604_000048_000001 Every plant in the grass is set formally, grows perfectly, and may be realized completely.
1188_133604_000048_000003 Thus, in Chaucer's "Dream":
1188_133604_000050_000003 In both, the vegetation, though beautiful, is absolutely wild and uncared for, as it seems, either by human or by higher powers, which, having appointed for it the laws of its being, leave it to spring into such beauty as is consistent with disease and alternate with decay.
1188_133604_000055_000000 in a few moments to lose her forever.
1188_133604_000055_000001 The other is a mythological subject of deeper meaning, the death of Procris.
1188_133604_000057_000001 I just now referred to the landscape by john Bellini in the National Gallery as one of the six best existing of the purist school, being wholly felicitous and enjoyable.
1188_133604_000060_000003 Once understand that, and you will see why Turner has put her death under this deep shade of trees, the sun withdrawing his last ray; and why he has put beside her the low type of an animal's pain, a dog licking its wounded paw.
1188_133604_000061_000002 In both these high mythical subjects the surrounding nature, though suffering, is still dignified and beautiful.
1188_133604_000061_000006 It has no beauty whatsoever, no specialty of picturesqueness; and all its lines are cramped and poor.
1188_133604_000062_000001 This is no longer to make us think of the death of happy souls, but of the labor of unhappy ones; at least, of the more or less limited, dullest, and-I must not say homely, but-unhomely life of the neglected agricultural poor.
1188_133604_000067_000002 And here I am able to show you, fortunately, one of his works painted at this time of his most earnest thought; when his imagination was still freshly filled with the Greek mythology, and he saw for the first time with his own eyes the clouds come down upon the actual earth.
121_121726_000000_000000 H
121_121726_000004_000003 Also, a popular contrivance whereby love making may be suspended but not stopped during the picnic season.
121_121726_000005_000001 The beggar's plea, the politician's sceptre and the drummer's ablest assistant.
121_121726_000007_000003 Painful to hear.
121_121726_000008_000002 Hence, full of strains.
121_121726_000020_000001 A Bill Poster.

121_127105_000000_000000 This is a LibriVox recording.
121_127105_000003_000000 THE TURN OF THE SCREW
121_127105_000007_000002 It was this observation that drew from Douglas-not immediately, but later in the evening-a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call attention. Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw he was not following.
121_127105_000007_000003 This I took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait.
121_127105_000007_000004 We waited in fact till two nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered, he brought out what was in his mind.
121_127105_000008_000000 "I quite agree-in regard to Griffin's ghost, or whatever it was-that its appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a particular touch.
121_127105_000008_000001 But it's not the first occurrence of its charming kind that I know to have involved a child.
121_127105_000008_000002 If the child gives the effect another turn of the screw, what do you say to TWO children-?"
121_127105_000009_000000 "We say, of course," somebody exclaimed, "that they give two turns!
121_127105_000010_000000 I can see Douglas there before the fire, to which he had got up to present his back, looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets.
121_127105_000010_000001 "Nobody but me, till now, has ever heard.
121_127105_000010_000002 It's quite too horrible." This, naturally, was declared by several voices to give the thing the utmost price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on: "It's beyond everything.
121_127105_000010_000003 Nothing at all that I know touches it."
121_127105_000011_000000 "For sheer terror?" I remember asking.
121_127105_000012_000000 He seemed to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss how to qualify it.
121_127105_000012_000001 He passed his hand over his eyes, made a little wincing grimace.
121_127105_000012_000002 "For dreadful-dreadfulness!"
121_127105_000013_000000 "Oh, how delicious!" cried one of the women.
121_127105_000014_000000 He took no notice of her; he looked at me, but as if, instead of me, he saw what he spoke of.
121_127105_000014_000001 "For general uncanny ugliness and horror and pain."
121_127105_000015_000000 "Well then," I said, "just sit right down and begin."
121_127105_000016_000000 He turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watched it an instant.
121_127105_000016_000001 Then as he faced us again: "I can't begin.
121_127105_000016_000002 I shall have to send to town." There was a unanimous groan at this, and much reproach; after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained.
121_127105_000016_000003 "The story's written.
121_127105_000016_000004 It's in a locked drawer-it has not been out for years.
121_127105_000016_000005 I could write to my man and enclose the key; he could send down the packet as he finds it." It was to me in particular that he appeared to propound this-appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate.
121_127105_000016_000006 He had broken a thickness of ice, the formation of many a winter; had had his reasons for a long silence.
121_127105_000016_000008 I adjured him to write by the first post and to agree with us for an early hearing; then I asked him if the experience in question had been his own.
121_127105_000016_000009 To this his answer was prompt.
121_127105_000017_000000 "And is the record yours?
121_127105_000017_000001 You took the thing down?"
121_127105_000018_000001 I took that HERE"--he tapped his heart. "I've never lost it."
121_127105_000019_000000 "Then your manuscript-?"
121_127105_000020_000001 "A woman's.
121_127105_000020_000002 She has been dead these twenty years.
121_127105_000020_000004 But if he put the inference by without a smile it was also without irritation.
121_127105_000020_000005 "She was a most charming person, but she was ten years older than i She was my sister's governess," he quietly said. "She was the most agreeable woman I've ever known in her position; she would have been worthy of any whatever.
121_127105_000020_000006 It was long ago, and this episode was long before.
121_127105_000020_000009 Oh yes; don't grin: I liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think she liked me, too.
121_127105_000020_000010 If she hadn't she wouldn't have told me.
121_127105_000020_000011 She had never told anyone.
121_127105_000020_000013 I was sure; I could see.
121_127105_000021_000000 "Because the thing had been such a scare?"
121_127105_000022_000000 He continued to fix me.
121_127105_000022_000001 "You'll easily judge," he repeated: "YOU will."
121_127105_000023_000001 "I see.
121_127105_000023_000002 She was in love."
121_127105_000024_000000 He laughed for the first time.
121_127105_000024_000001 "You ARE acute.
121_127105_000024_000002 Yes, she was in love. That is, she had been.
121_127105_000024_000006 He quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair.
121_127105_000025_000000 "You'll receive the packet Thursday morning?" I inquired.
121_127105_000026_000000 "Probably not till the second post."
121_127105_000027_000000 "Well then; after dinner-"
121_127105_000028_000000 "You'll all meet me here?"
121_127105_000028_000002 "Isn't anybody going?"
121_127105_000028_000003 It was almost the tone of hope.
121_127105_000029_000000 "Everybody will stay!"
121_127105_000030_000001 mrs Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more light.
121_127105_000030_000002 "Who was it she was in love with?"
121_127105_000032_000000 "Oh, I can't wait for the story!"
121_127105_000033_000000 "The story WON'T tell," said Douglas; "not in any literal, vulgar way."
121_127105_000034_000000 "More's the pity, then.
121_127105_000035_000000 "Won't YOU tell, Douglas?" somebody else inquired.
121_127105_000036_000000 He sprang to his feet again.
121_127105_000036_000001 "Yes-tomorrow.
121_127105_000036_000003 From our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on the stair; whereupon mrs Griffin spoke.
121_127105_000036_000004 "Well, if I don't know who she was in love with, I know who HE was."
121_127105_000037_000000 "She was ten years older," said her husband.
121_127105_000038_000001 But it's rather nice, his long reticence."
121_127105_000039_000000 "Forty years!" Griffin put in.
121_127105_000040_000000 "With this outbreak at last."
121_127105_000041_000000 "The outbreak," I returned, "will make a tremendous occasion of Thursday night;" and everyone so agreed with me that, in the light of it, we lost all attention for everything else.
121_127105_000041_000001 The last story, however incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial, had been told; we handshook and "candlestuck," as somebody said, and went to bed.
121_127105_000042_000001 Then he became as communicative as we could desire and indeed gave us his best reason for being so.
121_127105_000042_000003 It appeared that the narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue. Let me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative, from an exact transcript of my own made much later, is what I shall presently give.
121_127105_000042_000004 Poor Douglas, before his death-when it was in sight-committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth.
121_127105_000042_000005 The departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't, of course, thank heaven, stay: they departed, in consequence of arrangements made, in a rage of curiosity, as they professed, produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up.
121_127105_000042_000006 But that only made his little final auditory more compact and select, kept it, round the hearth, subject to a common thrill.
121_127105_000043_000000 The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun.
121_127105_000043_000002 This person proved, on her presenting herself, for judgment, at a house in Harley Street, that impressed her as vast and imposing-this prospective patron proved a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life, such a figure as had never risen, save in a dream or an old novel, before a fluttered, anxious girl out of a Hampshire vicarage.
121_127105_000043_000003 One could easily fix his type; it never, happily, dies out.
121_127105_000043_000004 He was handsome and bold and pleasant, offhand and gay and kind.
121_127105_000043_000006 She conceived him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant-saw him all in a glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming ways with women.
121_127105_000043_000007 He had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it was to his country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished her immediately to proceed.
121_127105_000044_000000 He had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to a small nephew and a small niece, children of a younger, a military brother, whom he had lost two years before.
121_127105_000044_000001 These children were, by the strangest of chances for a man in his position-a lone man without the right sort of experience or a grain of patience-very heavily on his hands.
121_127105_000044_000003 The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time.
121_127105_000044_000004 He had put them in possession of Bly, which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of their little establishment-but below stairs only-an excellent woman, mrs Grose, whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly been maid to his mother.
121_127105_000044_000007 She would also have, in holidays, to look after the small boy, who had been for a term at school-young as he was to be sent, but what else could be done?--and who, as the holidays were about to begin, would be back from one day to the other.
1221_135766_000015_000000 "Child, what art thou?" cried the mother.
1221_135766_000025_000001 "I have no Heavenly Father!"
1221_135766_000026_000000 "Hush, Pearl, hush!
1221_135766_000026_000005 Or, if not, thou strange and elfish child, whence didst thou come?"
1221_135766_000027_000002 "It is thou that must tell me!"
1221_135767_000019_000001 Look!
1221_135767_000019_000002 Look!"
1284_1180_000001_000000 The Crooked Magician
1284_1180_000004_000000 Ojo dressed.
1284_1180_000004_000004 Instead of shoes, the old man wore boots with turnover tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid.
1284_1180_000005_000001 Ojo was hungry, though; so he divided the piece of bread upon the table and ate his half for breakfast, washing it down with fresh, cool water from the brook.
1284_1180_000006_000000 Ojo was well pleased.
1284_1180_000006_000002 For a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful Land of Oz in which they lived.
1284_1180_000007_000000 At the foot of the mountain that separated the Country of the Munchkins from the Country of the Gillikins, the path divided.
1284_1180_000007_000001 One way led to the left and the other to the right-straight up the mountain.
1284_1180_000008_000001 Then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of dr Pipt.
1284_1180_000011_000000 "Ah," said Ojo; "you must be Dame Margolotte, the good wife of dr Pipt."
1284_1180_000015_000001 "We have come from a far lonelier place than this."
1284_1180_000016_000000 "A lonelier place!
1284_1180_000016_000001 And in the Munchkin Country?" she exclaimed.
1284_1180_000016_000002 "Then it must be somewhere in the Blue Forest."
1284_1180_000017_000000 "It is, good Dame Margolotte."
1284_1180_000018_000001 "And you must be Ojo the Unlucky," she added.
1284_1180_000020_000000 "I never knew I was called the Unlucky," said Ojo, soberly; "but it is really a good name for me."
1284_1180_000022_000000 "How can I lose that 'Un,' Dame Margolotte?"
1284_1180_000023_000000 "I do not know how, but you must keep the matter in mind and perhaps the chance will come to you," she replied.
1284_1180_000024_000001 There was a savory stew, smoking hot, a dish of blue peas, a bowl of sweet milk of a delicate blue tint and a blue pudding with blue plums in it.
1284_1180_000025_000000 "Do you wish to see dr Pipt on business or for pleasure?"
1284_1180_000027_000000 "We are traveling," replied Ojo, "and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves.
1284_1180_000028_000000 The woman seemed thoughtful.
1284_1180_000029_000001 The Magician is very busy, as I said, but if you will promise not to disturb him you may come into his workshop and watch him prepare a wonderful charm."
1284_1180_000030_000000 "Thank you," replied the boy, much pleased.
1284_1180_000030_000001 "I would like to do that."
1284_1180_000035_000000 "Perhaps the Powder of Life couldn't either," said Ojo.
1284_1180_000036_000000 "Yes; it is perfection," she declared.
1284_1180_000037_000000 "A Glass Cat!" exclaimed Ojo, astonished.
1284_1180_000039_000000 "What did old Mombi the Witch do with the Powder of Life your husband gave her?" asked the boy.
1284_1180_000040_000000 "She brought Jack Pumpkinhead to life, for one thing," was the reply. "I suppose you've heard of Jack Pumpkinhead.
1284_1180_000042_000001 "The more one knows, the luckier he is, for knowledge is the greatest gift in life."
1284_1180_000043_000000 "But tell me, please, what you intend to do with this new lot of the Powder of Life, which dr Pipt is making.
1284_1180_000043_000001 He said his wife wanted it for some especial purpose."
1284_1180_000044_000001 "I want it to bring my Patchwork Girl to life."
1284_1180_000045_000000 "Oh!
1284_1180_000045_000001 A Patchwork Girl?
1284_1180_000045_000002 What is that?" Ojo asked, for this seemed even more strange and unusual than a Glass Cat.
1284_1180_000046_000000 "I think I must show you my Patchwork Girl," said Margolotte, laughing at the boy's astonishment, "for she is rather difficult to explain.
1284_1180_000047_000000 "What is a patchwork quilt?" asked Ojo.
1284_1180_000049_000000 "Is blue the only respectable color, then?" inquired Ojo.
1284_1180_000050_000000 "Yes, for a Munchkin.
1284_1180_000050_000001 All our country is blue, you know.
1284_1180_000050_000002 But in other parts of Oz the people favor different colors.
1284_1180_000053_000001 I will show you what a good job I did," and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors.
1284_1181_000001_000000 Chapter Three
1284_1181_000003_000001 The Patchwork Girl was taller than he, when she stood upright, and her body was plump and rounded because it had been so neatly stuffed with cotton.
1284_1181_000003_000002 Margolotte had first made the girl's form from the patchwork quilt and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in it-using the same gay material throughout.
1284_1181_000003_000004 All the fingers and thumbs of the girl's hands had been carefully formed and stuffed and stitched at the edges, with gold plates at the ends to serve as finger nails.
1284_1181_000004_000000 "She will have to work, when she comes to life," said Margolotte.
1284_1181_000005_000000 The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her.
1284_1181_000008_000002 If I get tired looking at her patched face I can whitewash it."
1284_1181_000009_000000 "Has she any brains?" asked Ojo.
1284_1181_000012_000000 "No; I am sure I am right about that," returned the woman.
1284_1181_000013_000000 "He means," explained Ojo, "that unless your servant has good brains she won't know how to obey you properly, nor do the things you ask her to do."
1284_1181_000014_000000 "Well, that may be true," agreed Margolotte; "but, on the contrary, a servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work.
1284_1181_000014_000002 I want her to know just enough, but not too much."
1284_1181_000015_000002 "Ingenuity," "Amiability,"
1284_1181_000015_000003 "Learning," "Truth,"
1284_1181_000018_000000 "Little," said he.
1284_1181_000019_000000 "A little 'Cleverness'?
1284_1181_000020_000000 "Quick, Margolotte!
1284_1181_000020_000001 Come and help me."
1284_1181_000021_000003 When the mixture was complete there was scarcely a handful, all told.
1284_1181_000023_000002 No one saw him do this, for all were looking at the Powder of Life; but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing, and came back to the cupboard.
1284_1181_000026_000001 But the Magician replied:
1284_1181_000027_000000 "This powder must not be used before to morrow morning; but I think it is now cool enough to be bottled."
1284_1181_000028_000001 Very carefully he placed the Powder of Life in the gold bottle and then locked it up in a drawer of his cabinet.
1284_1181_000031_000000 "I know; but that renders your uncle a most agreeable companion and gossip," declared dr Pipt.
1284_1181_000031_000001 "Most people talk too much, so it is a relief to find one who talks too little."
1284_1181_000033_000000 "Don't you find it very annoying to be so crooked?" he asked.
1284_1181_000034_000000 "No; I am quite proud of my person," was the reply.
1284_1181_000036_000000 "I am not allowed to perform magic, except for my own amusement," he told his visitors, as he lighted a pipe with a crooked stem and began to smoke.
1284_1181_000037_000000 "Magic must be a very interesting study," said Ojo.
1284_1181_000038_000000 "It truly is," asserted the Magician.
1284_1181_000039_000000 "What does the Liquid of Petrifaction do?" inquired the boy.
1284_1181_000040_000005 It will never break nor wear out."
1284_1181_000042_000001 But just then there came a scratching at the back door and a shrill voice cried:
1284_1181_000045_000000 "Ask like a good cat, then," she said.
1284_1181_000047_000000 "Yes; that's proper cat talk," declared the woman, and opened the door.
1320_122612_000001_000000 CHAPTER twenty one
1320_122612_000002_000000 "If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death." --Merry Wives of Windsor.
1320_122612_000005_000001 The dews were suffered to exhale, and the sun had dispersed the mists, and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest, when the travelers resumed their journey.
1320_122612_000006_000000 After proceeding a few miles, the progress of Hawkeye, who led the advance, became more deliberate and watchful.
1320_122612_000006_000001 He often stopped to examine the trees; nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity, the velocity, and the color of its waters. Distrusting his own judgment, his appeals to the opinion of Chingachgook were frequent and earnest.
1320_122612_000006_000002 During one of these conferences Heyward observed that Uncas stood a patient and silent, though, as he imagined, an interested listener.
1320_122612_000006_000004 At last the scout spoke in English, and at once explained the embarrassment of their situation.
1320_122612_000007_000001 Human natur' is weak, and it is possible we may not have taken the proper scent."
1320_122612_000008_000002 Has Uncas no counsel to offer in such a strait?"
1320_122612_000009_000000 The young Mohican cast a glance at his father, but, maintaining his quiet and reserved mien, he continued silent.
1320_122612_000009_000001 Chingachgook had caught the look, and motioning with his hand, he bade him speak.
1320_122612_000009_000004 The eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement, and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed.
1320_122612_000010_000000 "'tis the trail!" exclaimed the scout, advancing to the spot; "the lad is quick of sight and keen of wit for his years."
1320_122612_000013_000000 "See!" said Uncas, pointing north and south, at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him, "the dark hair has gone toward the forest."
1320_122612_000014_000000 "Hound never ran on a more beautiful scent," responded the scout, dashing forward, at once, on the indicated route; "we are favored, greatly favored, and can follow with high noses.
1320_122612_000014_000002 The fellow is stricken with a judgment, and is mad!
1320_122612_000015_000000 The spirits of the scout, and the astonishing success of the chase, in which a circuitous distance of more than forty miles had been passed, did not fail to impart a portion of hope to the whole party.
1320_122612_000016_000004 But while the earth was trodden, and the footsteps of both men and beasts were so plainly visible around the place, the trail appeared to have suddenly ended.
1320_122612_000017_000000 It was easy to follow the tracks of the Narragansetts, but they seemed only to have wandered without guides, or any other object than the pursuit of food.
1320_122612_000019_000003 No, no; I have heard that the French Indians had come into these hills to hunt the moose, and we are getting within scent of their camp. Why should they not?
1320_122612_000019_000005 It is true that the horses are here, but the Hurons are gone; let us, then, hunt for the path by which they parted."
1320_122612_000020_000000 Hawkeye and the Mohicans now applied themselves to their task in good earnest.
1320_122612_000020_000001 A circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn, and each of the party took a segment for his portion.
1320_122612_000020_000003 The impressions of footsteps were numerous, but they all appeared like those of men who had wandered about the spot, without any design to quit it.
1320_122612_000021_000000 "Such cunning is not without its deviltry," exclaimed Hawkeye, when he met the disappointed looks of his assistants.
1320_122612_000023_000001 Not a leaf was left unturned.
1320_122612_000023_000002 The sticks were removed, and the stones lifted; for Indian cunning was known frequently to adopt these objects as covers, laboring with the utmost patience and industry, to conceal each footstep as they proceeded.
1320_122612_000023_000003 Still no discovery was made. At length Uncas, whose activity had enabled him to achieve his portion of the task the soonest, raked the earth across the turbid little rill which ran from the spring, and diverted its course into another channel. So soon as its narrow bed below the dam was dry, he stooped over it with keen and curious eyes.
1320_122612_000024_000001 Yet that is not the footstep of an Indian! the weight is too much on the heel, and the toes are squared, as though one of the French dancers had been in, pigeon winging his tribe!
1320_122612_000024_000002 Run back, Uncas, and bring me the size of the singer's foot.
1320_122612_000024_000003 You will find a beautiful print of it just opposite yon rock, agin the hillside."
1320_122612_000027_000000 "But," cried Duncan, "I see no signs of-"
1320_122612_000028_000000 "The gentle ones," interrupted the scout; "the varlet has found a way to carry them, until he supposed he had thrown any followers off the scent. My life on it, we see their pretty little feet again, before many rods go by."
1320_122612_000029_000000 The whole party now proceeded, following the course of the rill, keeping anxious eyes on the regular impressions.
1320_122612_000029_000001 The water soon flowed into its bed again, but watching the ground on either side, the foresters pursued their way content with knowing that the trail lay beneath.
1320_122612_000030_000000 It was fortunate they did so.
1320_122612_000030_000002 Pursuing the direction given by this discovery, he entered the neighboring thicket, and struck the trail, as fresh and obvious as it had been before they reached the spring.
1320_122612_000032_000000 "Shall we proceed?" demanded Heyward.
1320_122612_000033_000000 "Softly, softly, we know our path; but it is good to examine the formation of things.
1320_122612_000033_000001 This is my schooling, major; and if one neglects the book, there is little chance of learning from the open land of Providence.
1320_122612_000035_000003 Here we have three pair of moccasins, and two of little feet.
1320_122612_000035_000005 Pass me the thong of buckskin, Uncas, and let me take the length of this foot.
1320_122612_000035_000006 By the Lord, it is no longer than a child's and yet the maidens are tall and comely.
1320_122612_000035_000007 That Providence is partial in its gifts, for its own wise reasons, the best and most contented of us must allow."
1320_122612_000037_000000 "Of that there is little cause of fear," returned the scout, slowly shaking his head; "this is a firm and straight, though a light step, and not over long.
1320_122612_000037_000001 See, the heel has hardly touched the ground; and there the dark hair has made a little jump, from root to root.
1320_122612_000037_000002 No, no; my knowledge for it, neither of them was nigh fainting, hereaway.
1320_122612_000038_000000 From such undeniable testimony did the practised woodsman arrive at the truth, with nearly as much certainty and precision as if he had been a witness of all those events which his ingenuity so easily elucidated. Cheered by these assurances, and satisfied by a reasoning that was so obvious, while it was so simple, the party resumed its course, after making a short halt, to take a hurried repast.
1320_122612_000039_000003 Before an hour had elapsed, however, the speed of Hawkeye sensibly abated, and his head, instead of maintaining its former direct and forward look, began to turn suspiciously from side to side, as if he were conscious of approaching danger.
1320_122612_000039_000004 He soon stopped again, and waited for the whole party to come up.
1320_122612_000040_000000 "I scent the Hurons," he said, speaking to the Mohicans; "yonder is open sky, through the treetops, and we are getting too nigh their encampment. Sagamore, you will take the hillside, to the right; Uncas will bend along the brook to the left, while I will try the trail.
1320_122612_000040_000001 If anything should happen, the call will be three croaks of a crow.
1320_122612_000040_000002 I saw one of the birds fanning himself in the air, just beyond the dead oak-another sign that we are approaching an encampment."
1320_122612_000043_000001 Recovering his recollection on the instant, instead of sounding an alarm, which might prove fatal to himself, he remained stationary, an attentive observer of the other's motions.
1320_122612_000044_000000 An instant of calm observation served to assure Duncan that he was undiscovered.
1320_122612_000044_000002 It was impossible to discover the expression of his features through the grotesque mask of paint under which they were concealed, though Duncan fancied it was rather melancholy than savage. His head was shaved, as usual, with the exception of the crown, from whose tuft three or four faded feathers from a hawk's wing were loosely dangling.
1320_122612_000044_000003 A ragged calico mantle half encircled his body, while his nether garment was composed of an ordinary shirt, the sleeves of which were made to perform the office that is usually executed by a much more commodious arrangement.
1320_122612_000044_000005 Altogether, the appearance of the individual was forlorn and miserable.
1320_122612_000046_000000 "You see we have reached their settlement or encampment," whispered the young man; "and here is one of the savages himself, in a very embarrassing position for our further movements."
1320_122612_000047_000000 Hawkeye started, and dropped his rifle, when, directed by the finger of his companion, the stranger came under his view.
1320_122612_000047_000001 Then lowering the dangerous muzzle he stretched forward his long neck, as if to assist a scrutiny that was already intensely keen.
1320_122612_000048_000002 Can you see where he has put his rifle or his bow?"
1320_122612_000049_000000 "He appears to have no arms; nor does he seem to be viciously inclined. Unless he communicate the alarm to his fellows, who, as you see, are dodging about the water, we have but little to fear from him."
1320_122612_000050_000000 The scout turned to Heyward, and regarded him a moment with unconcealed amazement.
1320_122612_000051_000000 Repeating the words, "Fellows who are dodging about the water!" he added, "so much for schooling and passing a boyhood in the settlements! The knave has long legs, though, and shall not be trusted.
1320_122612_000051_000001 Do you keep him under your rifle while I creep in behind, through the bush, and take him alive.
1320_122612_000051_000002 Fire on no account."
1320_122612_000053_000000 "If I see you in danger, may I not risk a shot?"
1320_122612_000055_000000 "Fire a whole platoon, major."
1320_122612_000056_000000 In the next moment he was concealed by the leaves.
1320_122612_000056_000002 Then he reappeared, creeping along the earth, from which his dress was hardly distinguishable, directly in the rear of his intended captive.
1320_122612_000056_000003 Having reached within a few yards of the latter, he arose to his feet, silently and slowly.
1320_122612_000056_000006 Instead of taking the alarm, the unconscious savage stretched forward his neck, as if he also watched the movements about the gloomy lake, with a sort of silly curiosity.
1320_122612_000056_000007 In the meantime, the uplifted hand of Hawkeye was above him.
1320_122612_000057_000000 "How now, friend! have you a mind to teach the beavers to sing?"
1320_122617_000001_000000 CHAPTER twenty six
1320_122617_000013_000001 Now let us to business."
1320_122617_000017_000000 "Can you lead me to him?"
1320_122617_000021_000001 But it was not the policy of Hawkeye to affect the least concealment.
1320_122617_000022_000001 Still they betrayed no intention to depart.
1320_122617_000027_000002 But the bear, instead of obeying, maintained the seat it had taken, and growled:
1320_122617_000029_000001 Then, as if satisfied of their safety, the scout left his position, and slowly entered the place. It was silent and gloomy, being tenanted solely by the captive, and lighted by the dying embers of a fire, which had been used for the purposed of cookery.
1320_122617_000030_000002 The scout, who had left David at the door, to ascertain they were not observed, thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy.
1320_122617_000032_000000 "Hawkeye!"
1320_122617_000033_000000 "Cut his bands," said Hawkeye to David, who just then approached them.
1320_122617_000037_000000 "Whither?"
1320_122617_000043_000001 So, Uncas, you had better take the lead, while I will put on the skin again, and trust to cunning for want of speed."
1320_122617_000046_000000 "Uncas will stay," was the calm reply.
1320_122617_000047_000000 "For what?"
1320_122617_000049_000001 But I thought I would make the offer, seeing that youth commonly loves life.
1320_122617_000055_000002 If you stay, it must be to sit down here in the shadow, and take the part of Uncas, until such times as the cunning of the Indians discover the cheat, when, as I have already said, your times of trial will come.
1320_122617_000055_000003 So choose for yourself-to make a rush or tarry here."
1320_122617_000057_000001 Hold your head down, and draw in your legs; their formation might tell the truth too early.
1320_122617_000059_000000 The scout hesitated, and appeared to muse.
1320_122617_000064_000002 The little knot of Indians drew back in a body, and suffered, as they thought, the conjurer and his inspired assistant to proceed.
1320_122617_000067_000000 "Hold!" said the scout, grasping his friend by the shoulder, "let them yell again!
1320_122617_000067_000001 'twas nothing but wonderment."
1320_122617_000069_000000 "Now let the devils strike our scent!" said the scout, tearing two rifles, with all their attendant accouterments, from beneath a bush, and flourishing "killdeer" as he handed Uncas his weapon; "two, at least, will find it to their deaths."
1580_141083_000001_000002 With due discretion the incident itself may, however, be described, since it serves to illustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was remarkable. I will endeavour, in my statement, to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place, or give a clue as to the people concerned.
1580_141083_000002_000002 mr Soames was a tall, spare man, of a nervous and excitable temperament.
1580_141083_000003_000000 "I trust, mr Holmes, that you can spare me a few hours of your valuable time.
1580_141083_000004_000001 "I should much prefer that you called in the aid of the police."
1580_141083_000005_000003 I beg you, mr Holmes, to do what you can."
1580_141083_000006_000000 My friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street.
1580_141083_000006_000001 Without his scrapbooks, his chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man.
1580_141083_000006_000002 He shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence, while our visitor in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth his story.
1580_141083_000007_000000 "I must explain to you, mr Holmes, that to morrow is the first day of the examination for the Fortescue Scholarship.
1580_141083_000007_000001 I am one of the examiners.
1580_141083_000008_000000 "To day, about three o'clock, the proofs of this paper arrived from the printers.
1580_141083_000008_000001 The exercise consists of half a chapter of Thucydides.
1580_141083_000008_000002 I had to read it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely correct.
1580_141083_000008_000004 I had, however, promised to take tea in a friend's rooms, so I left the proof upon my desk.
1580_141083_000008_000005 I was absent rather more than an hour.
1580_141083_000009_000001 As I approached my outer door, I was amazed to see a key in it.
1580_141083_000009_000002 For an instant I imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket I found that it was all right.
1580_141083_000009_000004 I found that the key was indeed his, that he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very carelessly left the key in the door when he came out.
1580_141083_000010_000000 "The moment I looked at my table, I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers.
1580_141083_000010_000001 The proof was in three long slips.
1580_141083_000010_000002 I had left them all together.
1580_141083_000011_000000 Holmes stirred for the first time.
1580_141083_000012_000000 "The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the third where you left it," said he.
1580_141083_000013_000000 "Exactly, mr Holmes.
1580_141083_000013_000002 How could you possibly know that?"
1580_141083_000014_000000 "Pray continue your very interesting statement."
1580_141083_000015_000000 "For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpardonable liberty of examining my papers.
1580_141083_000015_000001 He denied it, however, with the utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was speaking the truth.
1580_141083_000015_000002 The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the papers.
1580_141083_000015_000003 A large sum of money is at stake, for the scholarship is a very valuable one, and an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk in order to gain an advantage over his fellows.
1580_141083_000016_000000 "Bannister was very much upset by the incident.
1580_141083_000016_000002 I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair, while I made a most careful examination of the room.
1580_141083_000016_000003 I soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled papers.
1580_141083_000016_000004 On the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened.
1580_141083_000016_000005 A broken tip of lead was lying there also.
1580_141083_000016_000006 Evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry, had broken his pencil, and had been compelled to put a fresh point to it."
1580_141083_000017_000000 "Excellent!" said Holmes, who was recovering his good humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case.
1580_141083_000018_000000 "This was not all.
1580_141083_000018_000001 I have a new writing table with a fine surface of red leather.
1580_141083_000018_000002 I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannister, that it was smooth and unstained.
1580_141083_000018_000003 Now I found a clean cut in it about three inches long-not a mere scratch, but a positive cut.
1580_141083_000018_000004 Not only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black dough or clay, with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it.
1580_141083_000018_000005 I am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers.
1580_141083_000018_000006 There were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity.
1580_141083_000018_000007 I was at my wit's end, when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town, and I came straight round to put the matter into your hands.
1580_141083_000018_000008 Do help me, mr Holmes.
1580_141083_000018_000009 You see my dilemma.
1580_141083_000018_000011 Above all things, I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly."
1580_141083_000019_000001 "The case is not entirely devoid of interest.
1580_141083_000021_000000 "For which he was entered?"
1580_141083_000022_000000 "Yes."
1580_141083_000024_000000 "To the best of my belief, they were rolled up."
1580_141083_000025_000000 "But might be recognized as proofs?"
1580_141083_000026_000000 "Possibly."
1580_141083_000028_000000 "no"
1580_141083_000029_000000 "Did anyone know that these proofs would be there?"
1580_141083_000030_000000 "No one save the printer."
1580_141083_000031_000000 "Did this man Bannister know?"
1580_141083_000033_000000 "Where is Bannister now?"
1580_141083_000034_000001 I left him collapsed in the chair.
1580_141083_000034_000002 I was in such a hurry to come to you."
1580_141083_000035_000000 "You left your door open?"
1580_141083_000036_000000 "I locked up the papers first."
1580_141083_000037_000000 "Then it amounts to this, mr Soames: that, unless the Indian student recognized the roll as being proofs, the man who tampered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing that they were there."
1580_141083_000038_000000 "So it seems to me."
1580_141083_000039_000000 Holmes gave an enigmatic smile.
1580_141083_000040_000000 "Well," said he, "let us go round.
1580_141083_000040_000001 Not one of your cases, Watson-mental, not physical.
1580_141083_000040_000002 All right; come if you want to.
1580_141083_000040_000003 Now, mr Soames-at your disposal!"
1580_141083_000041_000001 A Gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase.
1580_141083_000041_000002 On the ground floor was the tutor's room.
1580_141083_000041_000003 Above were three students, one on each story.
1580_141083_000041_000004 It was already twilight when we reached the scene of our problem.
1580_141083_000041_000005 Holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window.
1580_141083_000041_000006 Then he approached it, and, standing on tiptoe with his neck craned, he looked into the room.
1580_141083_000042_000000 "He must have entered through the door.
1580_141083_000042_000001 There is no opening except the one pane," said our learned guide.
1580_141083_000043_000001 "Well, if there is nothing to be learned here, we had best go inside."
1580_141083_000044_000000 The lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his room.
1580_141083_000044_000001 We stood at the entrance while Holmes made an examination of the carpet.
1580_141083_000045_000000 "I am afraid there are no signs here," said he.
1580_141083_000045_000001 "One could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day.
1580_141083_000045_000002 Your servant seems to have quite recovered. You left him in a chair, you say.
1580_141083_000045_000003 Which chair?"
1580_141083_000046_000000 "By the window there."
1580_141083_000047_000000 "I see.
1580_141083_000047_000003 I have finished with the carpet.
1580_141083_000047_000004 Let us take the little table first.
1580_141083_000047_000005 Of course, what has happened is very clear.
1580_141083_000047_000006 The man entered and took the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table.
1580_141083_000047_000007 He carried them over to the window table, because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard, and so could effect an escape."
1580_141083_000048_000000 "As a matter of fact, he could not," said Soames, "for I entered by the side door."
1580_141083_000049_000000 "Ah, that's good!
1580_141083_000049_000001 Well, anyhow, that was in his mind.
1580_141083_000049_000002 Let me see the three strips.
1580_141083_000049_000004 Well, he carried over this one first, and he copied it.
1580_141083_000049_000007 Then he tossed it down and seized the next.
1580_141083_000049_000008 He was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat-VERY hurried, since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there.
1580_141083_000051_000000 "Well, he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil, and had, as you observe, to sharpen it again.
1580_141083_000051_000001 This is of interest, Watson.
1580_141083_000051_000002 The pencil was not an ordinary one.
1580_141083_000054_000000 "You see?"
1580_141083_000056_000001 There are others.
1580_141083_000056_000002 What could this n n be?
1580_141083_000056_000003 It is at the end of a word.
1580_141083_000056_000004 You are aware that Johann Faber is the most common maker's name.
1580_141083_000056_000005 Is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the Johann?" He held the small table sideways to the electric light.
1580_141083_000056_000006 "I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin, some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface.
1580_141083_000056_000007 No, I see nothing.
1580_141083_000056_000010 As you say, there appear to be grains of sawdust in it.
1580_141083_000056_000011 Dear me, this is very interesting.
1580_141083_000056_000012 And the cut-a positive tear, I see.
1580_141083_000056_000013 It began with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole.
1580_141083_000056_000015 Where does that door lead to?"
1580_141083_000057_000000 "To my bedroom."
1580_141083_000058_000000 "Have you been in it since your adventure?"
1580_141083_000060_000000 "I should like to have a glance round.
1580_141083_000060_000004 What about this curtain?
1580_141083_000060_000007 No one there, I suppose?"
1580_141083_000061_000001 As a matter of fact, the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of pegs.
1580_141083_000063_000000 It was a small pyramid of black, putty like stuff, exactly like the one upon the table of the study.
1580_141083_000063_000001 Holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light.
1580_141083_000065_000000 "What could he have wanted there?"
1580_141083_000066_000000 "I think it is clear enough.
1580_141083_000066_000002 What could he do? He caught up everything which would betray him, and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself."
1580_141083_000067_000000 "Good gracious, mr Holmes, do you mean to tell me that, all the time I was talking to Bannister in this room, we had the man prisoner if we had only known it?"
1580_141083_000069_000000 "Surely there is another alternative, mr Holmes.
1580_141083_000069_000001 I don't know whether you observed my bedroom window?"
1580_141083_000070_000000 "Lattice paned, lead framework, three separate windows, one swinging on hinge, and large enough to admit a man."
1580_141083_000071_000000 "Exactly.
1580_141083_000071_000001 And it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to be partly invisible.
1580_141083_000071_000002 The man might have effected his entrance there, left traces as he passed through the bedroom, and finally, finding the door open, have escaped that way."
1580_141083_000072_000000 Holmes shook his head impatiently.
1580_141083_000073_000000 "Let us be practical," said he.
1580_141083_000074_000000 "Yes, there are."
1580_141083_000076_000000 "Yes."
1580_141083_000078_000000 Soames hesitated.
1580_141083_000079_000000 "It is a very delicate question," said he.
1580_141083_000079_000001 "One hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs."
1580_141083_000080_000001 I will look after the proofs."
1580_141083_000081_000000 "I will tell you, then, in a few words the character of the three men who inhabit these rooms.
1580_141083_000081_000001 The lower of the three is Gilchrist, a fine scholar and athlete, plays in the Rugby team and the cricket team for the college, and got his Blue for the hurdles and the long jump.
1580_141083_000081_000003 His father was the notorious Sir Jabez Gilchrist, who ruined himself on the turf.
1580_141083_000081_000004 My scholar has been left very poor, but he is hard-working and industrious.
1580_141083_000081_000005 He will do well.
1580_141083_000082_000001 He is a quiet, inscrutable fellow; as most of those Indians are.
1580_141083_000082_000002 He is well up in his work, though his Greek is his weak subject.
1580_141083_000083_000000 "The top floor belongs to Miles McLaren.
1580_141083_000083_000001 He is a brilliant fellow when he chooses to work-one of the brightest intellects of the university; but he is wayward, dissipated, and unprincipled.
1580_141083_000083_000002 He was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year.
1580_141083_000083_000003 He has been idling all this term, and he must look forward with dread to the examination."
1580_141083_000085_000000 "I dare not go so far as that.
1580_141083_000085_000001 But, of the three, he is perhaps the least unlikely."
1580_141083_000086_000000 "Exactly.
1580_141083_000087_000002 His plump face was twitching with his nervousness, and his fingers could not keep still.
1580_141083_000088_000000 "We are investigating this unhappy business, Bannister," said his master.
1580_141083_000090_000000 "I understand," said Holmes, "that you left your key in the door?"
1580_141083_000093_000000 "It was most unfortunate, sir.
1580_141083_000094_000000 "When did you enter the room?"
1580_141083_000095_000000 "It was about half past four.
1580_141083_000096_000000 "How long did you stay?"
1580_141083_000097_000000 "When I saw that he was absent, I withdrew at once."
1580_141083_000098_000000 "Did you look at these papers on the table?"
1580_141083_000099_000000 "No, sir-certainly not."
1580_141083_000100_000000 "How came you to leave the key in the door?"
1580_141083_000101_000000 "I had the tea tray in my hand.
1580_141083_000101_000001 I thought I would come back for the key. Then I forgot."
1580_141083_000106_000000 "Anyone in the room could get out?"
1580_141083_000107_000000 "Yes, sir."
1580_141083_000108_000000 "When mr Soames returned and called for you, you were very much disturbed?"
1580_141083_000109_000002 I nearly fainted, sir."
1580_141083_000110_000001 Where were you when you began to feel bad?"
1580_141083_000112_000001 Why did you pass these other chairs?"
1580_141083_000113_000000 "I don't know, sir, it didn't matter to me where I sat"
1580_141083_000114_000001 He was looking very bad-quite ghastly."
1580_141083_000117_000000 "Whom do you suspect?"
1580_141083_000119_000000 "Thank you, that will do," said Holmes.
1580_141083_000123_000000 "Very good.
1580_141083_000123_000001 Now, mr Soames, we will take a walk in the quadrangle, if you please."
1580_141084_000005_000001 What's that?
1580_141084_000005_000002 One of them seems restless enough."
1580_141084_000006_000000 It was the Indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind.
1580_141084_000006_000001 He was pacing swiftly up and down his room.
1580_141084_000007_000000 "I should like to have a peep at each of them," said Holmes.
1580_141084_000007_000001 "Is it possible?"
1580_141084_000008_000000 "No difficulty in the world," Soames answered.
1580_141084_000008_000002 Come along, and I will personally conduct you."
1580_141084_000009_000000 "No names, please!" said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist's door.
1580_141084_000009_000001 A tall, flaxen haired, slim young fellow opened it, and made us welcome when he understood our errand.
1580_141084_000009_000002 There were some really curious pieces of mediaeval domestic architecture within.
1580_141084_000009_000003 Holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted on drawing it in his notebook, broke his pencil, had to borrow one from our host and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his own.
1580_141084_000009_000005 I could not see that in either case Holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching.
1580_141084_000009_000007 The outer door would not open to our knock, and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it.
1580_141084_000009_000008 "I don't care who you are.
1580_141084_000012_000000 "Can you tell me his exact height?" he asked.
1580_141084_000013_000000 "Really, mr Holmes, I cannot undertake to say.
1580_141084_000013_000001 He is taller than the Indian, not so tall as Gilchrist.
1580_141084_000013_000002 I suppose five foot six would be about it."
1580_141084_000014_000000 "That is very important," said Holmes.
1580_141084_000014_000001 "And now, mr Soames, I wish you good night."
1580_141084_000015_000000 Our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay.
1580_141084_000015_000001 "Good gracious, mr Holmes, you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt fashion! You don't seem to realize the position.
1580_141084_000015_000003 I must take some definite action to night.
1580_141084_000015_000004 I cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with.
1580_141084_000015_000005 The situation must be faced."
1580_141084_000016_000001 I shall drop round early to morrow morning and chat the matter over.
1580_141084_000016_000002 It is possible that I may be in a position then to indicate some course of action.
1580_141084_000016_000003 Meanwhile, you change nothing-nothing at all."
1580_141084_000017_000000 "Very good, mr Holmes."
1580_141084_000018_000000 "You can be perfectly easy in your mind.
1580_141084_000018_000002 I will take the black clay with me, also the pencil cuttings.
1580_141084_000018_000003 Good bye."
1580_141084_000019_000000 When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle, we again looked up at the windows.
1580_141084_000019_000001 The Indian still paced his room.
1580_141084_000019_000002 The others were invisible.
1580_141084_000020_000005 Which is yours?"
1580_141084_000021_000000 "The foul mouthed fellow at the top.
1580_141084_000021_000001 He is the one with the worst record.
1580_141084_000022_000000 "There is nothing in that.
1580_141084_000022_000001 Many men do it when they are trying to learn anything by heart."
1580_141084_000023_000000 "He looked at us in a queer way."
1580_141084_000024_000002 Pencils, too, and knives-all was satisfactory.
1580_141084_000024_000003 But that fellow DOES puzzle me."
1580_141084_000025_000000 "Who?"
1580_141084_000026_000000 "Why, Bannister, the servant.
1580_141084_000026_000001 What's his game in the matter?"
1580_141084_000027_000000 "He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man."
1580_141084_000028_000001 That's the puzzling part.
1580_141084_000028_000002 Why should a perfectly honest man-Well, well, here's a large stationer's.
1580_141084_000029_000000 There were only four stationers of any consequences in the town, and at each Holmes produced his pencil chips, and bid high for a duplicate.
1580_141084_000029_000001 All were agreed that one could be ordered, but that it was not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock.
1580_141084_000029_000002 My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure, but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation.
1580_141084_000030_000000 "No good, my dear Watson.
1580_141084_000030_000001 This, the best and only final clue, has run to nothing.
1580_141084_000030_000002 But, indeed, I have little doubt that we can build up a sufficient case without it.
1580_141084_000030_000004 What with your eternal tobacco, Watson, and your irregularity at meals, I expect that you will get notice to quit, and that I shall share your downfall-not, however, before we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor, the careless servant, and the three enterprising students."
1580_141084_000031_000000 Holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day, though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner.
1580_141084_000032_000001 Can you do without breakfast?"
1580_141084_000033_000000 "Certainly."
1580_141084_000035_000000 "Have you anything positive to tell him?"
1580_141084_000036_000000 "I think so."
1580_141084_000038_000000 "Yes, my dear Watson, I have solved the mystery."
1580_141084_000039_000000 "But what fresh evidence could you have got?"
1580_141084_000040_000000 "Aha!
1580_141084_000040_000001 It is not for nothing that I have turned myself out of bed at the untimely hour of six.
1580_141084_000040_000003 Look at that!"
1580_141084_000041_000001 On the palm were three little pyramids of black, doughy clay.
1580_141084_000043_000000 "And one more this morning.
1580_141084_000043_000003 Well, come along and put friend Soames out of his pain."
1580_141084_000044_000000 The unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation when we found him in his chambers.
1580_141084_000044_000001 In a few hours the examination would commence, and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship. He could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched.
1580_141084_000045_000003 Shall the examination proceed?"
1580_141084_000046_000000 "Yes, let it proceed, by all means."
1580_141084_000047_000000 "But this rascal?"
1580_141084_000048_000000 "He shall not compete."
1580_141084_000049_000000 "You know him?"
1580_141084_000050_000000 "I think so.
1580_141084_000050_000001 If this matter is not to become public, we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial.
1580_141084_000050_000002 You there, if you please, Soames!
1580_141084_000050_000003 Watson you here!
1580_141084_000050_000004 I'll take the armchair in the middle.
1580_141084_000050_000006 Kindly ring the bell!"
1580_141084_000051_000000 Bannister entered, and shrank back in evident surprise and fear at our judicial appearance.
1580_141084_000052_000000 "You will kindly close the door," said Holmes.
1580_141084_000052_000001 "Now, Bannister, will you please tell us the truth about yesterday's incident?"
1580_141084_000054_000000 "I have told you everything, sir."
1580_141084_000055_000000 "Nothing to add?"
1580_141084_000056_000000 "Nothing at all, sir."
1580_141084_000057_000000 "Well, then, I must make some suggestions to you.
1580_141084_000058_000000 Bannister's face was ghastly.
1580_141084_000059_000000 "No, sir, certainly not."
1580_141084_000060_000001 "I frankly admit that I am unable to prove it.
1580_141084_000061_000000 Bannister licked his dry lips.
1580_141084_000063_000000 "Ah, that's a pity, Bannister.
1580_141084_000063_000001 Up to now you may have spoken the truth, but now I know that you have lied."
1580_141084_000064_000000 The man's face set in sullen defiance.
1580_141084_000065_000000 "There was no man, sir."
1580_141084_000066_000000 "Come, come, Bannister!"
1580_141084_000068_000000 "In that case, you can give us no further information.
1580_141084_000069_000000 An instant later the tutor returned, bringing with him the student.
1580_141084_000069_000001 He was a fine figure of a man, tall, lithe, and agile, with a springy step and a pleasant, open face.
1580_141084_000069_000002 His troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us, and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon Bannister in the farther corner.
1580_141084_000070_000000 "Just close the door," said Holmes.
1580_141084_000070_000001 "Now, mr Gilchrist, we are all quite alone here, and no one need ever know one word of what passes between us.
1580_141084_000070_000002 We can be perfectly frank with each other.
1580_141084_000071_000000 The unfortunate young man staggered back, and cast a look full of horror and reproach at Bannister.
1580_141084_000072_000000 "No, no, mr Gilchrist, sir, I never said a word-never one word!" cried the servant.
1580_141084_000074_000000 For a moment Gilchrist, with upraised hand, tried to control his writhing features.
1580_141084_000074_000001 The next he had thrown himself on his knees beside the table, and burying his face in his hands, he had burst into a storm of passionate sobbing.
1580_141084_000075_000000 "Come, come," said Holmes, kindly, "it is human to err, and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal.
1580_141084_000075_000001 Perhaps it would be easier for you if I were to tell mr Soames what occurred, and you can check me where I am wrong.
1580_141084_000075_000002 Shall I do so?
1580_141084_000076_000000 "From the moment, mr Soames, that you said to me that no one, not even Bannister, could have told that the papers were in your room, the case began to take a definite shape in my mind.
1580_141084_000076_000001 The printer one could, of course, dismiss.
1580_141084_000076_000002 He could examine the papers in his own office.
1580_141084_000076_000004 If the proofs were in a roll, he could not possibly know what they were.
1580_141084_000076_000005 On the other hand, it seemed an unthinkable coincidence that a man should dare to enter the room, and that by chance on that very day the papers were on the table.
1580_141084_000076_000006 I dismissed that.
1580_141084_000076_000007 The man who entered knew that the papers were there.
1580_141084_000076_000008 How did he know?
1580_141084_000077_000000 "When I approached your room, I examined the window.
1580_141084_000077_000002 Such an idea was absurd.
1580_141084_000077_000003 I was measuring how tall a man would need to be in order to see, as he passed, what papers were on the central table.
1580_141084_000077_000004 I am six feet high, and I could do it with an effort. No one less than that would have a chance.
1580_141084_000078_000000 "I entered, and I took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table.
1580_141084_000078_000001 Of the centre table I could make nothing, until in your description of Gilchrist you mentioned that he was a long distance jumper.
1580_141084_000079_000002 As he passed your window he saw, by means of his great height, these proofs upon your table, and conjectured what they were.
1580_141084_000079_000003 No harm would have been done had it not been that, as he passed your door, he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant.
1580_141084_000079_000005 It was not a dangerous exploit for he could always pretend that he had simply looked in to ask a question.
1580_141084_000080_000001 He put his shoes on the table.
1580_141084_000080_000002 What was it you put on that chair near the window?"
1580_141084_000081_000000 "Gloves," said the young man.
1580_141084_000082_000000 Holmes looked triumphantly at Bannister.
1580_141084_000082_000001 "He put his gloves on the chair, and he took the proofs, sheet by sheet, to copy them.
1580_141084_000082_000002 He thought the tutor must return by the main gate and that he would see him.
1580_141084_000082_000003 As we know, he came back by the side gate.
1580_141084_000082_000005 There was no possible escape.
1580_141084_000082_000007 You observe that the scratch on that table is slight at one side, but deepens in the direction of the bedroom door.
1580_141084_000082_000010 Have I told the truth, mr Gilchrist?"
1580_141084_000083_000000 The student had drawn himself erect.
1580_141084_000084_000000 "Yes, sir, it is true," said he.
1580_141084_000085_000000 "Good heavens! have you nothing to add?" cried Soames.
1580_141084_000086_000000 "Yes, sir, I have, but the shock of this disgraceful exposure has bewildered me.
1580_141084_000086_000002 It was before I knew that my sin had found me out.
1580_141084_000086_000003 Here it is, sir.
1580_141084_000086_000004 You will see that I have said, 'I have determined not to go in for the examination.
1580_141084_000087_000001 "But why did you change your purpose?"
1580_141084_000088_000000 Gilchrist pointed to Bannister.
1580_141084_000089_000000 "There is the man who set me in the right path," said he.
1580_141084_000090_000000 "Come now, Bannister," said Holmes.
1580_141084_000090_000001 "It will be clear to you, from what I have said, that only you could have let this young man out, since you were left in the room, and must have locked the door when you went out. As to his escaping by that window, it was incredible.
1580_141084_000091_000001 Time was, sir, when I was butler to old Sir Jabez Gilchrist, this young gentleman's father. When he was ruined I came to the college as servant, but I never forgot my old employer because he was down in the world.
1580_141084_000091_000003 Well, sir, when I came into this room yesterday, when the alarm was given, the very first thing I saw was mr Gilchrist's tan gloves a lying in that chair.
1580_141084_000091_000004 I knew those gloves well, and I understood their message.
1580_141084_000091_000005 If mr Soames saw them, the game was up.
1580_141084_000091_000006 I flopped down into that chair, and nothing would budge me until mr Soames he went for you.
1580_141084_000091_000008 Wasn't it natural, sir, that I should save him, and wasn't it natural also that I should try to speak to him as his dead father would have done, and make him understand that he could not profit by such a deed?
1580_141084_000092_000000 "No, indeed," said Holmes, heartily, springing to his feet.
1580_141084_000092_000002 Come, Watson!
1580_141084_000092_000003 As to you, sir, I trust that a bright future awaits you in Rhodesia.
1688_142285_000000_000000 'Margaret!' said mr Hale, as he returned from showing his guest downstairs; 'I could not help watching your face with some anxiety, when mr Thornton made his confession of having been a shop boy.
1688_142285_000000_000001 I knew it all along from mr Bell; so I was aware of what was coming; but I half expected to see you get up and leave the room.'
1688_142285_000001_000001 I really liked that account of himself better than anything else he said.
1688_142285_000002_000000 'I am surprised at you, Margaret,' said her mother.
1688_142285_000002_000002 I don't think, mr Hale, you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been.
1688_142285_000002_000003 I really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked I was at some parts of what he said.
1688_142285_000002_000004 His father "dying in miserable circumstances." Why it might have been in the workhouse.'
1688_142285_000003_000002 His father speculated wildly, failed, and then killed himself, because he could not bear the disgrace.
1688_142285_000003_000004 No one came forwards to help the mother and this boy.
1688_142285_000003_000005 There was another child, I believe, a girl; too young to earn money, but of course she had to be kept.
1688_142285_000003_000006 At least, no friend came forwards immediately, and mrs Thornton is not one, I fancy, to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out.
1688_142285_000003_000008 mr Bell said they absolutely lived upon water porridge for years-how, he did not know; but long after the creditors had given up hope of any payment of old mr Thornton's debts (if, indeed, they ever had hoped at all about it, after his suicide,) this young man returned to Milton, and went quietly round to each creditor, paying him the first instalment of the money owing to him.
1688_142285_000003_000010 Bell says), taking in mr Thornton as a kind of partner.'
1688_142285_000005_000000 'How tainted?' asked her father.
1688_142285_000006_000000 'Oh, papa, by that testing everything by the standard of wealth.
1688_142285_000006_000001 When he spoke of the mechanical powers, he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money.
1688_142285_000006_000002 And the poor men around him-they were poor because they were vicious-out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his iron nature, and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich.'
1688_142285_000007_000000 'Not vicious; he never said that.
1688_142285_000007_000001 Improvident and self indulgent were his words.'
1688_142285_000008_000000 Margaret was collecting her mother's working materials, and preparing to go to bed.
1688_142285_000010_000000 'And I do!' said her father laughing.
1688_142285_000010_000001 'Personally, as you call it, and all.
1688_142285_000010_000002 I don't set him up for a hero, or anything of that kind.
1688_142285_000010_000003 But good night, child.
1688_142285_000010_000004 Your mother looks sadly tired to night, Margaret.'
1688_142285_000011_000000 Margaret had noticed her mother's jaded appearance with anxiety for some time past, and this remark of her father's sent her up to bed with a dim fear lying like a weight on her heart.
1688_142285_000011_000002 There were several other signs of something wrong about mrs Hale.
1688_142285_000011_000006 But though she received caresses and fond words back again, in such profusion as would have gladdened her formerly, yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her, and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health.
1688_142285_000011_000007 She lay awake very long this night, planning how to lessen the evil influence of their Milton life on her mother.
1688_142285_000011_000009 Visiting register offices, seeing all manner of unlikely people, and very few in the least likely, absorbed Margaret's time and thoughts for several days.
1688_142285_000011_000010 One afternoon she met Bessy Higgins in the street, and stopped to speak to her.
1688_142285_000014_000000 'Not exactly,' replied Margaret, smiling.
1688_142285_000015_000002 At last she said in a low voice,
1688_142285_000017_000000 Bessy was silent in her turn for a minute or two.
1688_142285_000021_000000 'But what was it?
1688_142285_000025_000000 'I had forgotten what I said for the time,' continued Margaret quietly. 'I should have thought of it again when I was less busy.
1688_142285_000030_000000 But Nicholas was not at home when they entered.
1688_142285_000031_000001 Margaret did not speak, but held the water to her lips.
1688_142285_000032_000000 Margaret bent over and said, 'Bessy, don't be impatient with your life, whatever it is-or may have been.
1688_142285_000033_000000 'Now, I'll not have my wench preached to.
1688_142285_000034_000000 'But surely,' said Margaret, facing round, 'you believe in what I said, that God gave her life, and ordered what kind of life it was to be?'
1688_142285_000035_000000 'I believe what I see, and no more.
1688_142285_000036_000001 That's my creed.
1688_142285_000036_000002 It's simple, and not far to fetch, nor hard to work.'
1688_142285_000038_000000 'Don't think hardly on him-he's a good man, he is.
1688_142285_000039_000000 Margaret held her in her arms, and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom.
1688_142285_000043_000000 Margaret went away very sad and thoughtful.
1688_142285_000044_000000 She was late for tea at home.
1688_142285_000044_000001 At Helstone unpunctuality at meal times was a great fault in her mother's eyes; but now this, as well as many other little irregularities, seemed to have lost their power of irritation, and Margaret almost longed for the old complainings.
1688_142285_000045_000000 'Have you met with a servant, dear?'
1688_142285_000046_000000 'No, mamma; that Anne Buckley would never have done.'
1688_142285_000047_000001 'Everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty.
1688_142285_000047_000002 Now let me try.
1688_142285_000047_000003 I may be the Cinderella to put on the slipper after all.'
1688_142285_000049_000001 How would you set about it?'
1688_142285_000051_000000 'Very good.
1688_142285_000051_000001 But we must first catch our house mother.'
1688_142285_000052_000000 'You have caught her.
1688_142285_000055_000001 Thornton!' exclaimed mrs Hale.
1688_142285_000056_000000 'The mother of whom he spoke to us?' said Margaret.
1688_142285_000058_000000 'I shall like to see her.
1688_142285_000058_000001 She must be an uncommon person,' her mother added.
1688_142285_000059_000000 'Perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us, and be glad of our place.
1995_1826_000004_000000 Miss Mary Taylor did not take a college course for the purpose of teaching Negroes.
1995_1826_000004_000001 Not that she objected to Negroes as human beings-quite the contrary.
1995_1826_000004_000003 Nevertheless, when the end of the summer came and the only opening facing her was the teaching of children at Miss Smith's experiment in the Alabama swamps, it must be frankly confessed that Miss Taylor was disappointed.
1995_1826_000005_000001 She had pictured herself earning this by teaching one or two of her "specialties" in some private school near New York or Boston, or even in a Western college.
1995_1826_000005_000002 The South she had not thought of seriously; and yet, knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate, she was not averse to Charleston or New Orleans.
1995_1826_000005_000003 But from the offer that came to teach Negroes-country Negroes, and little ones at that-she shrank, and, indeed, probably would have refused it out of hand had it not been for her queer brother, john.
1995_1826_000006_000001 "Might learn something useful down there."
1995_1826_000008_000000 "But, john, there's no society-just elementary work-"
1995_1826_000010_000000 "Been looking up Tooms County.
1995_1826_000010_000002 Some others, too; big cotton county."
1995_1826_000011_000000 "You ought to know, john, if I teach Negroes I'll scarcely see much of people in my own class."
1995_1826_000012_000000 "Nonsense!
1995_1826_000012_000002 Show off.
1995_1826_000012_000003 Give 'em your Greek-and study Cotton.
1995_1826_000012_000004 At any rate, I say go."
1995_1826_000013_000000 And so, howsoever reluctantly, she had gone.
1995_1826_000016_000000 "What's the mere color of a human soul's skin," she had cried to a Wellesley audience and the audience had applauded with enthusiasm.
1995_1826_000016_000001 But here in Alabama, brought closely and intimately in touch with these dark skinned children, their color struck her at first with a sort of terror-it seemed ominous and forbidding.
1995_1826_000016_000004 She groped for new ways to teach colored brains and marshal colored thoughts and the result was puzzling both to teacher and student.
1995_1826_000016_000007 Miss Smith represented the older New England of her parents-honest, inscrutable, determined, with a conscience which she worshipped, and utterly unselfish.
1995_1826_000016_000008 She appealed to Miss Taylor's ruddier and daintier vision but dimly and distantly as some memory of the past.
1995_1826_000016_000009 The other teachers were indistinct personalities, always very busy and very tired, and talking "school room" with their meals.
1995_1826_000016_000010 Miss Taylor was soon starving for human companionship, for the lighter touches of life and some of its warmth and laughter.
1995_1826_000016_000011 She wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and reforms.
1995_1826_000016_000012 She felt out of the world, shut in and mentally anaemic; great as the "Negro Problem" might be as a world problem, it looked sordid and small at close range.
1995_1826_000016_000013 So for the hundredth time she was thinking today, as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn, and then slowly down through the bottoms.
1995_1826_000018_000000 She paused.
1995_1826_000018_000004 The glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her, stretching away to the Northward. She remembered that beyond this little world it stretched on and on-how far she did not know-but on and on in a great trembling sea, and the foam of its mighty waters would one time flood the ends of the earth.
1995_1826_000020_000000 She glanced absently at the boys.
1995_1826_000021_000001 Then her New England conscience stepped in.
1995_1826_000022_000000 "Cotton is a wonderful thing, is it not, boys?" she said rather primly. The boys touched their hats and murmured something indistinctly.
1995_1826_000022_000001 Miss Taylor did not know much about cotton, but at least one more remark seemed called for.
1995_1826_000026_000000 "What is planted over there?" she asked, although she really didn't care.
1995_1826_000027_000000 "Goobers," answered the smaller boy.
1995_1826_000028_000000 "Goobers?" uncomprehendingly.
1995_1826_000029_000000 "Peanuts," Bles specified.
1995_1826_000030_000000 "Oh!" murmured Miss Taylor.
1995_1826_000030_000002 I suppose, though, it's too early for them."
1995_1826_000031_000000 Then came the explosion.
1995_1826_000031_000002 And Bles-was Miss Taylor deceived?--or was he chuckling?
1995_1826_000031_000003 She reddened, drew herself up, and then, dropping her primness, rippled with laughter.
1995_1826_000033_000000 He looked at her with twinkling eyes.
1995_1826_000035_000000 The word was often on Miss Taylor's lips, and she recognized it.
1995_1826_000036_000000 "Of course, it isn't-I don't know anything about farming.
1995_1826_000036_000001 But what did I say so funny?"
1995_1826_000037_000000 Bles was now laughing outright.
1995_1826_000038_000001 I declare!
1995_1826_000039_000000 "Is that so?"
1995_1826_000042_000000 His eyes lighted, for cotton was to him a very real and beautiful thing, and a life-long companion, yet not one whose friendship had been coarsened and killed by heavy toil.
1995_1826_000045_000001 But it's prettiest when the bolls come and swell and burst, and the cotton covers the field like foam, all misty-"
1995_1826_000046_000001 The poetry of the thing began to sing within her, awakening her unpoetic imagination, and she murmured:
1995_1826_000047_000000 "The Golden Fleece-it's the Silver Fleece!"
1995_1826_000048_000000 He harkened.
1995_1826_000051_000000 "No, ma'am," he said eagerly; then glancing up toward the Cresswell fields, he saw two white men watching them.
1995_1826_000051_000001 He grasped his hoe and started briskly to work.
1995_1826_000055_000000 She began to realize that in this pleasant little chat the fact of the boy's color had quite escaped her; and what especially puzzled her was that this had not happened before.
1995_1826_000056_000000 She started thinking of cotton-but at once she pulled herself back to the other aspect.
1995_1826_000056_000001 Always before she had been veiled from these folk: who had put the veil there?
1995_1826_000057_000000 The longer she thought, the more bewildered she grew.
1995_1836_000003_000002 At last the Cotton Combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the Senate.
1995_1836_000003_000003 The price he had paid was high: he was to represent the interests of the new trust and sundry favorable measures were already drafted and reposing in the safe of the combine's legal department.
1995_1836_000003_000004 Among others was one relating to child labor, another that would effect certain changes in the tariff, and a proposed law providing for a cotton bale of a shape and dimensions different from the customary-the last constituting a particularly clever artifice which, under the guise of convenience in handling, would necessitate the installation of entirely new gin and compress machinery, to be supplied, of course, by the trust.
1995_1836_000004_000001 After all why should he care?
1995_1836_000004_000002 He had tried independence and philanthropy and failed.
1995_1836_000004_000003 Why should he not be as other men?
1995_1836_000004_000005 They were gentlemen.
1995_1836_000004_000006 Why should he pose as better than his fellows?
1995_1836_000004_000007 There was young Cresswell.
1995_1836_000004_000008 Did his aristocratic air prevent his succumbing to the lure of millions and promising the influence of his father and the whole Farmer's League to the new project?
1995_1836_000004_000010 The door opened softly.
1995_1836_000004_000012 There was just the touch of early autumn chill in the air without, that made both the fire and the table with its soft linen, gold and silver plate, and twinkling glasses a warming, satisfying sight.
1995_1836_000005_000001 She was not herself a notably intelligent woman; she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others.
1995_1836_000007_000000 mrs Grey's chef was high priced and efficient, and her butler was the envy of many; consequently, she knew the dinner would be good.
1995_1836_000007_000001 To her intense satisfaction, it was far more than this.
1995_1836_000007_000002 It was a most agreeable couple of hours; all save perhaps mr Smith unbent, the Englishman especially, and the Vanderpools were most gracious; but if the general pleasure was owing to any one person particularly it was to mr Harry Cresswell.
1995_1836_000008_000000 "Why, I thought," said mrs Grey, "that you Southerners rather disapproved-or at least-"
1995_1836_000009_000000 mr Cresswell inclined his head courteously.
1995_1836_000011_000000 They all glanced at Miss Cresswell, who lay softly back in her chair like a white lily, gleaming and bejewelled, her pale face flushing under the scrutiny; mrs Grey was horrified.
1995_1836_000013_000000 mr Cresswell sipped his wine slowly.
1995_1836_000015_000000 "Really, now, you do not mean to say that there is a danger of-of amalgamation, do you?" he sang.
1995_1836_000016_000000 mr Cresswell explained.
1995_1836_000016_000001 No, of course there was no immediate danger; but when people were suddenly thrust beyond their natural station, filled with wild ideas and impossible ambitions, it meant terrible danger to Southern white women.
1995_1836_000018_000000 "I believe in the training of people to their highest capacity." The Englishman here heartily seconded him.
1995_1836_000019_000000 "But," Cresswell added significantly, "capacity differs enormously between races."
1995_1836_000022_000000 Then Mary Taylor, whose conscience was uncomfortable, said:
1995_1836_000023_000000 "But, mr Cresswell, you surely believe in schools like Miss Smith's?"
1995_1836_000025_000000 mrs Grey was gratified and murmured something of Miss Smith's "sacrifice."
1995_1836_000026_000000 "Positively heroic," added Cresswell, avoiding his sister's eyes.
1995_1836_000028_000000 mrs Grey wanted particulars.
1995_1836_000028_000001 "What did you disagree about?" she asked bluntly.
1995_1836_000030_000000 "But you mean to say you can't even advise her?"
1995_1836_000031_000000 "Oh, no; we can.
1995_1836_000035_000001 mrs Grey wanted to hear the incident, but the young man was politely reluctant.
1995_1836_000036_000000 "Fortunately," said mr Vanderpool, "Northerners and Southerners are arriving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters."
1995_1836_000037_000000 "Yes, indeed," Cresswell agreed.
1995_1836_000041_000000 "I thought the only excuse for fighting was a great Right; if Right is on neither side or simultaneously on both, then War is not only Hell but Damnation."
1995_1836_000042_000000 mrs Grey looked shocked and mrs Vanderpool smiled.
1995_1836_000045_000000 Very soon after dinner Charles Smith excused himself.
1995_1837_000010_000000 Child?
1995_1837_000010_000005 To her all things meant something-nothing was aimless, nothing merely happened.
1995_1837_000011_000001 Bles rushed to the edge of the swamp and stood there irresolute.
1995_1837_000011_000002 Perhaps-if the water had but drained from the cotton!--it was so strong and tall! But, p shaw!
1995_1837_000011_000003 Where was the use of imagining?
1995_1837_000012_000000 Perhaps she, too, might be there, waiting, weeping.
1995_1837_000012_000001 He started at the thought.
1995_1837_000012_000002 He hurried forth sadly.
1995_1837_000012_000003 The rain drops were still dripping and gleaming from the trees, flashing back the heavy yellow sunlight.
1995_1837_000012_000004 He splashed and stamped along, farther and farther onward until he neared the rampart of the clearing, and put foot upon the tree bridge.
1995_1837_000012_000005 Then he looked down.
1995_1837_000012_000006 The lagoon was dry.
1995_1837_000012_000008 A great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place, and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green, thick, tall, wet, and willowy.
1995_1837_000013_000000 The swamp, the eternal swamp, had been drained in its deepest fastness; but, how?--how?
1995_1837_000013_000001 He gazed about, perplexed, astonished.
1995_1837_000013_000002 What a field of cotton! what a marvellous field!
1995_1837_000014_000000 He skirted the island slowly, stopping near Zora's oak.
1995_1837_000014_000001 Here lay the reading of the riddle: with infinite work and pain, some one had dug a canal from the lagoon to the creek, into which the former had drained by a long and crooked way, thus allowing it to empty directly.
1995_1837_000015_000003 There she lay-wet, bedraggled, motionless, gray pallid beneath her dark drawn skin, her burning eyes searching restlessly for some lost thing, her lips a moaning.
1995_1837_000016_000001 The earth staggered beneath him as he stumbled on; the mud splashed and sunlight glistened; he saw long snakes slithering across his path and fear struck beasts fleeing before his coming.
1995_1837_000017_000000 "Miss Smith-!" he gasped, and then-darkness.
1995_1837_000019_000000 The hope and dream of harvest was upon the land.
1995_1837_000019_000001 The cotton crop was short and poor because of the great rain; but the sun had saved the best, and the price had soared.
1995_1837_000019_000002 So the world was happy, and the face of the black belt green and luxuriant with thickening flecks of the coming foam of the cotton.
1995_1837_000020_000000 Up in the sick room Zora lay on the little white bed.
1995_1837_000020_000001 The net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her; she had struggled in dumb, speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strove for her life, with gnarled and creeping fingers; but now at last, weakly, she opened her eyes and questioned.
1995_1837_000021_000001 The Silver Fleece, how was it?
1995_1837_000021_000002 The Sun, the Swamp? Then finding all well, she closed her eyes and slept.
1995_1837_000021_000003 After some days they let her sit by the window, and she saw Bles pass, but drew back timidly when he looked; and he saw only the flutter of her gown, and waved.
1995_1837_000022_000003 Bles did not know yet that she was down; but soon he would come searching, for he came each hour, and she pressed her little hands against her breast to still the beating of her heart and the bursting wonder of her love.
1995_1837_000023_000000 Then suddenly a panic seized her.
1995_1837_000023_000003 The dark mystery of the Swamp swept over her; the place was hers.
1995_1837_000023_000006 A great white foam was spread upon its brown and green; the whole field was waving and shivering in the sunlight.
1995_1837_000024_000000 He heard that she was down stairs and ran to meet her with beating heart.
1995_1837_000024_000001 The chair was empty; but he knew.
1995_1837_000024_000003 Yet it was far, and he feared, and ran with startled eyes.
1995_1837_000025_000000 She stood on the island, ethereal, splendid, like some tall, dark, and gorgeous flower of the storied East.
1995_1837_000026_000002 He came down to her slowly, with fixed, hungry eyes, threading his way amid the Fleece.
1995_1837_000026_000003 She did not move, but lifted both her dark hands, white with cotton; and then, as he came, casting it suddenly to the winds, in tears and laughter she swayed and dropped quivering in his arms.
1998_15444_000001_000001 He should make inquiries as to symptoms, and time at which food or medicine was last taken.
1998_15444_000001_000002 He should take possession of any food, medicine, vomited matter, urine, or faeces, in the room, and should seal them up in clean vessels for examination.
1998_15444_000001_000003 He should notice the position and temperature of the body, the condition of rigor mortis, marks of violence, appearance of lips and mouth.
1998_15444_000001_000005 In making a post mortem examination, the alimentary canal should be removed and preserved for further investigation.
1998_15444_000001_000006 A double ligature should be passed round the oesophagus, and also round the duodenum a few inches below the pylorus.
1998_15444_000001_000008 The intestines may be removed in a similar way, and the whole or a portion of the liver should be preserved.
1998_15444_000001_000009 These should all be put in separate jars without any preservative fluid, tied up, sealed, labelled, and initialled.
1998_15444_000001_000010 All observations should be at once committed to writing, or they will not be admitted by the court for the purpose of refreshing the memory whilst giving evidence.
1998_15444_000001_000011 If the medical practitioner is in doubt on any point, he should obtain technical assistance from someone who has paid attention to the subject.
1998_15444_000002_000000 In a case of attempted suicide by poisoning, is it the duty of the doctor to inform the police?
1998_15444_000002_000001 He would be unwise to do so.
1998_15444_000002_000002 He had much better stick to his own business, and not act as an amateur detective.
1998_15444_000003_000000 seven.--TREATMENT OF POISONING
1998_15444_000004_000000 The modes of treatment may be ranged under three heads: (one) To eliminate the poison; (two) to antagonize its action; (three) to avert the tendency to death.
1998_15444_000005_000001 The first indication is met by the administration of emetics, to produce vomiting, or by the application of the stomach tube.
1998_15444_000005_000002 The best emetic is that which is at hand.
1998_15444_000005_000003 If there is a choice, give apomorphine hypodermically.
1998_15444_000005_000004 The dose for an adult is ten minims.
1998_15444_000005_000005 It may be given in the form of the injection of the Pharmacopoeia, or preferably as a tablet dissolved in water.
1998_15444_000005_000006 Apomorphine is not allied in physiological action to morphine, and may be given in cases of narcotic poisoning. Sulphate of zinc, salt and water, ipecacuanha, and mustard, are all useful as emetics.
1998_15444_000005_000007 Tickling the fauces with a feather may excite vomiting.
1998_15444_000006_000000 In using the elastic stomach tube, some fluid should be introduced into the stomach before attempting to empty it, or a portion of the mucous membrane may be sucked into the aperture.
1998_15444_000006_000001 The tube should be examined to see that it is not broken or cracked, as accidents have happened from neglecting this precaution.
1998_15444_000007_000001 The second indication is met by the administration of the appropriate antidote.
1998_15444_000007_000003 In the absence of a hypodermic syringe, the remedy may be given by the rectum.
1998_15444_000007_000005 Antidotes may act (one) chemically, by forming harmless compounds, as lime in oxalic acid poisoning; (two) physiologically, the drug which is administered neutralizing more or less completely the poison which has been absorbed; (three) physically, as charcoal.
1998_15444_000007_000006 Every doctor should provide himself with an antidote case.
1998_15444_000007_000007 The various antidotes will be mentioned under their respective poisons.
1998_15444_000008_000001 To avert the tendency to death, we must endeavour to palliate the symptoms and neutralize the effects of the poison.
1998_15444_000008_000003 In the case of narcotics and depressing agents, stimulants, electricity, and cold affusions, may be found useful.
1998_15444_000008_000004 We should endeavour to promote the elimination of the poison from the body by stimulating the secretions.
1998_15444_000009_000000 eight.--DETECTION OF POISONS
1998_15444_000010_000000 Notice the smell, colour, and general appearance, of the matter submitted for examination.
1998_15444_000010_000001 The odour may show the presence of prussic acid, alcohol, opium, or phosphorus.
1998_15444_000010_000002 The colour may indicate salts of copper, cantharides, etc
1998_15444_000010_000003 Seeds of plants may be found.
1998_15444_000011_000000 This examination having been made, the contents of the alimentary canal, and any other substances to be examined, must be submitted to chemical processes.
1998_15444_000012_000000 Simple filtration will sometimes suffice to separate the required substance; in other cases dialysis will be necessary, in order that crystalloid substances may be separated from colloid bodies.
1998_15444_000013_000000 In the case of volatile substances distillation will be required.
1998_15444_000013_000003 The flask is heated in a water bath, and the vapours condensed by a Liebig's condenser.
1998_15444_000013_000004 In the case of phosphorus the condenser should be of glass, and the process of distillation conducted in the dark, so that the luminosity of the phosphorus may be noted.
1998_15444_000014_000003 Make a solution of the contents of the stomach or solid organs minced very fine by digesting them with acidulated alcohol or water and filtering.
1998_15444_000014_000004 The filtrate is shaken with ether to remove fat, etc, the ether separated, the watery solution neutralized with soda, and then shaken with ether, which removes the alkaloid in a more or less impure condition.
1998_15444_000014_000007 On the evaporation of the alcohol the resinous and fatty matters separate.
1998_15444_000014_000008 Filter through a filter moistened with water.
1998_15444_000014_000009 Evaporate the filtrate to a syrup, and extract with successive portions of absolute alcohol.
1998_15444_000014_000011 Evaporate filtrate to dryness, and dissolve residue in water, the solution being made distinctly acid.
1998_15444_000014_000013 Separate the ethereal solution and evaporate.
1998_15444_000014_000015 The ether floats on the surface, holding the alkaloids, except morphine, in solution. (five) A part of this ethereal solution is poured into a watch glass and allowed to evaporate.
1998_15444_000014_000016 If the alkaloid is volatile, oily streaks appear on the glass; if not volatile, crystalline traces will be visible.
1998_15444_000015_000001 To purify it, add a small quantity of dilute sulphuric acid, and, after evaporating to three quarters of its bulk, add a saturated solution of carbonate of potash or soda.
1998_15444_000015_000002 Absolute alcohol will then dissolve out the alkaloid, and leave it on evaporation in a crystalline form.
1998_15444_000017_000000 In order to isolate an inorganic substance from organic matter, Fresenius's method is adopted.
1998_15444_000017_000002 Treat this with excess of bisulphate of sodium, then saturate with sulphuretted hydrogen until metals are thrown down as sulphides. These may be collected and tested.
1998_15444_000017_000005 The residue of the material after digestion with hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate may have to be examined for silver, lead, and barium.
1998_29454_000000_000000 Dickie left the shop without his moonflowers, indeed, but with his Tinkler now whitely shining, and declared to be "real silver, and mind you take care of it, my lad," his white cornelian seal carefully packed in a strong little cardboard box with metal corners.
1998_29454_000000_000001 Also a broken backed copy of "Ingoldsby Legends" and one of "mrs Markham's English History," which had no back at all.
1998_29454_000000_000002 "You must go on trying to improve your mind," said the pawnbroker fussily.
1998_29454_000000_000003 He was very pleased with himself for having been so kind.
1998_29454_000000_000004 "And come back and see me-say next month."
1998_29454_000001_000000 "I will," said Dickie.
1998_29454_000001_000001 "A thousand blessings from a grateful heart.
1998_29454_000001_000002 I will come back.
1998_29454_000001_000003 I say, you are good!
1998_29454_000001_000004 Thank you, thank you-I will come back next month, and tell you everything I have learned from the Perru Sal of your books."
1998_29454_000004_000002 There was a loose board in his room, where the man "saw to" the gas.
1998_29454_000005_000000 Not a moment too soon.
1998_29454_000006_000000 "Come along down, can't you?
1998_29454_000008_000000 It was a very long time indeed before he came back.
1998_29454_000008_000002 He had never seen one before, and it interested him extremely.
1998_29454_000008_000003 He longed to see it unpack itself and display its wonders, and he followed it through more streets than he knew; and when he found that it was not going to unpack at all, but was just going home to its bed in an old coach house, he remembered the fire wood; and the halfpenny clutched tight and close in his hand seemed to reproach him warmly.
1998_29454_000009_000000 He looked about him, and knew that he did not at all know where he was. There was a tall, thin, ragged man lounging against a stable door in the yard where the Punch and Judy show lived.
1998_29454_000009_000001 He took his clay pipe out of his mouth to say-
1998_29454_000010_000000 "What's up, matey?
1998_29454_000011_000000 Dickie explained.
1998_29454_000013_000000 "I'm going that way myself," said the man, getting away from the wall. "We'll go back by the boat if you like.
1998_29454_000013_000001 Ever been on the boat?"
1998_29454_000014_000000 "No," said Dickie.
1998_29454_000015_000000 "Like to?"
1998_29454_000016_000000 "Don't mind if I do," said Dickie.
1998_29454_000017_000001 The wind blew freshly, and the ragged man found a sheltered corner behind the funnel.
1998_29454_000017_000002 It was so sheltered, and the wind had been so strong that Dickie felt sleepy.
1998_29454_000018_000000 "Here we are!" said the man.
1998_29454_000018_000001 "'Ave you been asleep?
1998_29454_000019_000000 "Is this Deptford?" Dickie asked.
1998_29454_000019_000001 And the people shoving and crushing to get off the steamer laughed when he said it.
1998_29454_000020_000000 "Not exackly," said the man, "but it's all right.
1998_29454_000021_000001 Fried eggs and bacon-he had one egg and the man had three-bread and butter-and if the bread was thick, so was the butter-and as many cups of tea as you liked to say thank you for.
1998_29454_000021_000002 When it was over the man asked Dickie if he could walk a little way, and when Dickie said he could they set out in the most friendly way side by side.
1998_29454_000022_000000 "I like it very much, and thank you kindly," said Dickie presently.
1998_29454_000022_000003 And this is the prettiest place ever I see.
1998_29454_000022_000005 I shall catch it a fair treat as it is.
1998_29454_000023_000000 "Mother?"
1998_29454_000024_000002 Only I calls her that."
1998_29454_000025_000000 "She any good?"
1998_29454_000027_000002 Why, it's hours and hours since you and me got acquainted.
1998_29454_000027_000003 Look! the sun's just going."
1998_29454_000028_000000 It was, over trees more beautiful than anything Dickie had ever seen, for they were now in a country road, with green hedges and green grass growing beside it, in which little round faced flowers grew-daisies they were-even Dickie knew that.
1998_29454_000029_000000 "I got to stick it," said Dickie sadly.
1998_29454_000029_000001 "I'd best be getting home."
1998_29454_000030_000001 "I'd go out and see the world a bit, I would."
1998_29454_000031_000000 "What-me?" said Dickie.
1998_29454_000032_000000 "Why not?
1998_29454_000032_000004 Ever seed the sea?"
1998_29454_000033_000000 "No," said Dickie.
1998_29454_000033_000001 "Oh, no-no, I never."
1998_29454_000034_000000 "Well, you come alonger me.
1998_29454_000035_000000 "You 'ave that," said Dickie.
1998_29454_000036_000001 So now I make you a fair offer.
1998_29454_000036_000003 What do you say, matey?"
1998_29454_000038_000000 "Is it country where you going?" said Dickie, looking at the green hedge.
1998_29454_000039_000000 "All the way, pretty near," said the man.
1998_29454_000039_000003 I lay you'll get some color in them cheeks o' yours.
1998_29454_000039_000005 Come, now.
1998_29454_000039_000006 What you say?
1998_29454_000039_000007 Is it a bargain?"
1998_29454_000042_000000 "It's very kind of you," said Dickie, "but what call you got to do it? It'll cost a lot-my victuals, I mean.
1998_29454_000042_000001 What call you got to do it?"
1998_29454_000043_000001 Then he looked up at the sky and then down at the road-they were resting on a heap of stones.
1998_29454_000044_000000 At last he said, "You're a sharp lad, you are-bloomin' sharp.
1998_29454_000044_000002 I want company.
1998_29454_000044_000003 Tramping alone ain't no beano to me.
1998_29454_000044_000005 They comes down 'andsomer if there's a nipper.
1998_29454_000044_000007 Some blokes don't, but I do."
1998_29454_000045_000000 Dickie felt that this was true.
1998_29454_000045_000001 But-"We'll be beggars, you mean?" he said doubtfully.
1998_29454_000046_000002 Take it or leave it."
1998_29454_000047_000000 The sun shot long golden beams through the gaps in the hedge.
1998_29454_000047_000001 A bird paused in its flight on a branch quite close and clung there swaying.
1998_29454_000047_000002 A real live bird.
1998_29454_000047_000003 Dickie thought of the kitchen at home, the lamp that smoked, the dirty table, the fender full of ashes and dirty paper, the dry bread that tasted of mice, and the water out of the broken earthenware cup.
1998_29454_000047_000004 That would be his breakfast, when he had gone to bed crying after his aunt had slapped him.
1998_29454_000049_000000 "Mind you," said the man carefully, "this ain't no kidnapping.
1998_29454_000050_000000 "Oh, yes."
1998_29454_000051_000000 "Can you write?"
1998_29454_000052_000000 "Yes," said Dickie, "if I got a pen."
1998_29454_000053_000000 "I got a pencil-hold on a bit." He took out of his pocket a new envelope, a new sheet of paper, and a new pencil ready sharpened by machinery.
1998_29454_000053_000001 It almost looked, Dickie thought, as though he had brought them out for some special purpose.
1998_29454_000054_000000 "Now," said the man, "you take an' write-make it flat agin the sole of me boot." He lay face downward on the road and turned up his boot, as though boots were the most natural writing desks in the world.
1998_29454_000055_000000 "Now write what I say: 'mr
1998_29454_000055_000002 Dear Sir.
1998_29454_000056_000000 "Dickie Harding."
1998_29454_000057_000000 "Get it wrote down, then.
1998_29454_000057_000002 I'm glad I wasn't born a table to be wrote on.
1998_29454_000058_000000 He rolled over, took the paper and read it slowly and with difficulty. Then he folded it and put it in his pocket.
1998_29454_000059_000000 "Now we're square," he said.
1998_29454_000059_000002 And don't you forget it."
1998_29454_000060_000000 To the people who live in Rosemary Terrace the words "police court" are very alarming indeed.
1998_29454_000060_000001 Dickie turned a little paler and said, "Why police?
1998_29454_000061_000001 They could put a man away for less than that."
1998_29454_000064_000000 "I see that there in a book," said Dickie, charmed.
1998_29454_000064_000001 "He Reward the Wake, the last of the English, and I wunnered what it stood for."
1998_29454_000067_000001 I believe you!" said the man.
1998_29454_000067_000002 "Why, only last month a brute of a dog bit me in the leg, at a back door Sutton way.
1998_29454_000069_000001 But big!
1998_29454_000069_000004 I should think so!"
1998_29454_000071_000000 "Tired?" asked mr Beale presently.
1998_29454_000072_000000 "Just a tiddy bit, p'raps," said Dickie bravely, "but I can stick it."
1998_29454_000074_000000 "It's this 'ere nasty boot as makes me tired," said Dickie.
1998_29454_000075_000001 T'other too if you like.
1998_29454_000075_000002 You can keep to the grass."
1998_29454_000076_000002 Dickie always remembered that moment.
1998_29454_000076_000003 It was the first time in his life that he really enjoyed being clean.
1998_29454_000076_000004 In the hospital you were almost too clean; and you didn't do it yourself.
1998_29454_000076_000005 That made all the difference.
1998_29454_000077_000000 "So you shall," said mr Beale; "a reg'ler wash all over-this very night.
1998_29454_000077_000001 I always like a wash meself.
1998_29454_000077_000002 Some blokes think it pays to be dirty.
1998_29454_000078_000001 "I do like you."
1998_29454_000079_000000 mr Beale looked at him through the deepening twilight-rather queerly, Dickie thought.
1998_29454_000079_000001 Also he sighed heavily.
1998_29454_000081_000000 "I know you will," said Dickie, with enthusiasm.
1998_29454_000082_000000 "Bless me!" said mr Beale uncomfortably.
1998_29454_000082_000001 "Well, there.
1998_29454_000084_000000 "And-here we are," said mr Beale, stopping in a side street at an open door from which yellow light streamed welcomingly.
1998_29454_000084_000002 And don't you forget you're my nipper, and you got to call me daddy."
1998_29455_000002_000000 BURGLARS
1998_29455_000006_000000 He laid in bed and heard jolly voices talking and singing in the kitchen below.
1998_29455_000008_000000 Next morning, quite early, they took the road.
1998_29455_000008_000001 From some mysterious source mr Beale had obtained an old double perambulator, which must have been made, Dickie thought, for very fat twins, it was so broad and roomy.
1998_29455_000011_000000 "And that pillowy bundle on the seat."
1998_29455_000012_000000 "That's our clothes.
1998_29455_000013_000001 mr Beale looked down at the touch.
1998_29455_000014_000000 "Swelp me!" he said helplessly.
1998_29455_000014_000001 Then, "Does it hurt you-walking?"
1998_29455_000015_000000 "Not like it did 'fore I went to the orspittle.
1998_29455_000018_000000 "They're only weeds," said Beale.
1998_29455_000022_000000 It was a wonderful day.
1998_29455_000022_000001 All the country sights and sounds, that you hardly notice because you have known them every year as long as you can remember, were wonderful magic to the little boy from Deptford.
1998_29455_000023_000000 "In you gets," he said suddenly; "you'll be fair knocked.
1998_29455_000023_000001 You can look about you just as well a sittin' down," he added, laying the crutch across the front of the perambulator.
1998_29455_000023_000002 "Never see such a nipper for noticing, neither.
1998_29455_000023_000003 Hi! there goes a rabbit.
1998_29455_000023_000006 See him?"
1998_29455_000024_000000 Dickie saw, and the crown was set on his happiness.
1998_29455_000024_000001 A rabbit.
1998_29455_000024_000002 Like the ones that his fancy had put in the mouldering hutch at home.
1998_29455_000025_000000 "It's got loose," said Dickie, trying to scramble out of the perambulator; "let's catch 'im and take 'im along."
1998_29455_000026_000002 Gets 'is own meals and larks about on 'is own."
1998_29455_000027_000000 "How beautiful!" said Dickie, wriggling with delight.
1998_29455_000027_000002 "I'd like to be a rabbit."
1998_29455_000028_000000 "You much better be my little nipper," said Beale.
1998_29455_000030_000000 "It's better'n Fiff of November," said Dickie; "and I do like you.
1998_29455_000030_000001 I like you nexter my own daddy and mr Baxter next door."
1998_29455_000031_000000 "That's all right," said mr Beale awkwardly.
1998_29455_000037_000000 mr Beale went more and more slowly, and as the lady and the little girl drew near he stopped altogether and touched his cap.
1998_29455_000037_000001 Dickie, quick to imitate, touched his.
1998_29455_000041_000001 She died in the infirmary.
1998_29455_000041_000002 Three months ago it was, mum.
1998_29455_000042_000000 Dickie sniffed.
1998_29455_000043_000000 "Poor little man!" said the lady; "you miss your mother, don't you?"
1998_29455_000050_000000 "But if you've got silver you oughtn't to be begging," said the lady, shutting up her purse.
1998_29455_000055_000000 "You're a kind father," said the lady.
1998_29455_000056_000000 "Yes, isn't he, mother?" said the little girl.
1998_29455_000060_000002 A bit of all right, I call it!"
1998_29455_000061_000000 They went on up the hill as happy as any one need wish to be.
1998_29455_000062_000001 Please do not be too shocked.
1998_29455_000062_000002 Remember that neither of them knew any better.
1998_29455_000062_000003 To the elder tramp lies and begging were natural means of livelihood.
1998_29455_000062_000004 To the little tramp the whole thing was a new and entrancing game of make believe.
1998_29455_000063_000000 By evening they had seven and sixpence.
1998_29455_000065_000000 "But you said the bed with the green curtains," urged Dickie.
1998_29455_000066_000000 "Well, p'rhaps you're right.
1998_29455_000066_000004 Come on, mate."
1998_29455_000067_000000 And Dickie for the first time slept out of doors.
1998_29455_000067_000001 Have you ever slept out of doors?
1998_29455_000067_000002 The night is full of interesting little sounds that will not, at first, let you sleep-the rustle of little wild things in the hedges, the barking of dogs in distant farms, the chirp of crickets and the croaking of frogs.
1998_29455_000069_000000 "Blessed if I ever see such a nipper," he said, over and over again.
1998_29455_000071_000001 Couldn't get a nipper."
1998_29455_000073_000001 "That's all you know!
1998_29455_000073_000002 'E's a wunner, and no bloomin' error.
1998_29455_000073_000005 And to 'ear the way 'e does the patter to me on the road.
1998_29455_000077_000000 mr Beale laughed.
1998_29455_000077_000001 Then he spat thoughtfully.
1998_29455_000077_000002 Then he said-
1998_29455_000079_000000 "Seems to me you're a bit dotty about this 'ere extry double nipper.
1998_29455_000079_000001 I never knew you took like it afore."
1998_29455_000082_000003 But 'e's never let it out."
1998_29455_000083_000002 See?
1998_29455_000083_000004 I got the plan drawed out.
1998_29455_000084_000000 When Dickie came back, without mushrooms, the red whiskered man was gone.
1998_29455_000085_000000 "See that bloke just now?" said mr Beale.
1998_29455_000087_000002 Might a passed 'im in a crowd-see?"
1998_29455_000093_000000 It was not the next day, which was a Saturday, that they took the train like dukes.
1998_29455_000094_000001 Its pavements were of red brick and its houses of white stone, and its bow windows and balconies were green, and Dickie thought it was the prettiest town in the world.
1998_29455_000094_000002 They did not stay there, but walked out across the downs, where the skylarks were singing, and on a dip of the downs came upon great stone walls and towers very strong and gray.
1998_29455_000095_000000 "What's that there?" said Dickie.
1998_29455_000096_000000 "It's a carstle-like wot the King's got at Windsor."
1998_29455_000097_000000 "Is it a king as lives 'ere, then?" Dickie asked.
1998_29455_000098_000000 "No! Nobody don't live 'ere, mate," said mr Beale.
1998_29455_000098_000001 "It's a ruin, this is.
1998_29455_000098_000002 Only howls and rats lives in ruins."
1998_29455_000099_000000 "Did any one ever live in it?"
1998_29455_000100_000000 "I shouldn't wonder," said mr Beale indifferently.
1998_29455_000100_000001 "Yes, course they must 'ave, come to think of it.
1998_29455_000100_000002 But you learned all that at school.
2033_164914_000003_000000 When it was the Seventy second Night,
2033_164914_000004_000002 Thou must know who it was, seeing that thou art awake." The Fireman feared for Zau al Makan and said in himself, "Haply the Eunuch will do him some hurt"; so he answered, "By Allah, I know not who it was." Said the Eunuch, "By Allah, thou liest, for there is none on wake here but thou!
2033_164914_000008_000002 He who recited the first time hath recited a second time and I heard him hard by.
2033_164914_000008_000005 If he refuse, hand to him this purse of a thousand diners, then leave him and return to me and tell me, after thou hast informed thyself of his place and his calling and what countryman he is.
2033_164914_000008_000006 Return quickly and linger not."--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
2033_164914_000010_000004 Thou wottest none can stir from his place, except the watchman seize him.
2033_164914_000010_000007 If thou fear no one, I fear for thee and for my life, so Allah upon thee! recite nothing more of verses till thou come to thine own land.
2033_164914_000010_000008 Indeed, I had not deemed thee so ill conditioned.
2033_164914_000010_000009 Dost thou not know that this lady is the wife; of the Chamberlain and is minded to chastise thee for disturbing her?
2033_164914_000012_000001 Then said the Eunuch to Zau al Makan, "Peace be with thee, O my lord!"
2033_164914_000013_000000 When it was the Seventy fourth Night,
2033_164914_000014_000002 So the Castrato began to speak him fair and say to him, "O my lord, take this purse and go with me.
2033_164915_000017_000011 So it was agreed that we go to Damascus and fetch thence the King's son, Sharrkan, and make him Sultan over his father's realm.
2033_164916_000005_000018 I was then sitting by his side and he, seeing in her the signs of asceticism and devoutness, made her draw near and take seat hard by him.
2033_164916_000005_000019 And when she had sat down she addressed him and said, 'Know, O King, that with me are five damsels, whose like no King among the Kings possesseth; for they are endowed with wit and beauty and loveliness and perfection.
2033_164916_000005_000020 They read the Koran-and the Traditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in the history of bygone races.
2033_164916_000005_000021 They stand here between thy hands to do thee service, O King of the Age, and it is by trial that folk are prized or despised.
2300_131720_000002_000001 The Paris plant, like that at the Crystal Palace, was a temporary exhibit.
2300_131720_000002_000002 The London plant was less temporary, but not permanent, supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels, churches, stores, and dwellings in the vicinity of Holborn Viaduct.
2300_131720_000002_000003 There Messrs. Johnson and Hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art, and secured much useful data for the work in New York, of which the story has just been told.
2300_131720_000003_000000 As a matter of fact the first Edison commercial station to be operated in this country was that at appleton wisconsin, but its only serious claim to notice is that it was the initial one of the system driven by water power.
2300_131720_000003_000001 It went into service august fifteenth eighteen eighty two, about three weeks before the Pearl Street station.
2300_131720_000003_000002 It consisted of one small dynamo of a capacity of two hundred and eighty lights of ten c.p. each, and was housed in an unpretentious wooden shed.
2300_131720_000003_000003 The dynamo electric machine, though small, was robust, for under all the varying speeds of water power, and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it, belonged, it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nine--seventeen years.
2300_131720_000004_000000 Edison was from the first deeply impressed with the possibilities of water power, and, as this incident shows, was prompt to seize such a very early opportunity.
2300_131720_000004_000001 But his attention was in reality concentrated closely on the supply of great centres of population, a task which he then felt might well occupy his lifetime; and except in regard to furnishing isolated plants he did not pursue further the development of hydro-electric stations.
2300_131720_000004_000002 That was left to others, and to the application of the alternating current, which has enabled engineers to harness remote powers, and, within thoroughly economical limits, transmit thousands of horse power as much as two hundred miles at pressures of eighty thousand and one hundred thousand volts.
2300_131720_000004_000003 Owing to his insistence on low pressure, direct current for use in densely populated districts, as the only safe and truly universal, profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers, Edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current.
2300_131720_000004_000004 This does him an injustice.
2300_131720_000004_000006 Why, if we erect a station at the falls, it is a great economy to get it up to the city.
2300_131720_000004_000007 By digging a cheap trench and putting in an insulated cable, and connecting such station with the central part of Richmond, having the end of the cable come up into the station from the earth and there connected with motors, the power of the falls would be transmitted to these motors.
2300_131720_000004_000011 Everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy, the contraction of space, the intensification of culture.
2300_131720_000004_000012 Burbank and his tribe represent in the vegetable world, Edison in the mechanical.
2300_131720_000005_000001 When the alternating current was introduced for practical purposes it was not needed for arc lighting, the circuit for which, from a single dynamo, would often be twenty or thirty miles in length, its current having a pressure of not less than five or six thousand volts.
2300_131720_000005_000002 For some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits, and that reason was often urged against it seriously.
2300_131720_000005_000003 It could not be used for electroplating or deposition, nor could it charge storage batteries, all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current.
2300_131720_000005_000005 Its thin wires can be carried cheaply over vast areas, and at each local point of consumption the transformer of size exactly proportioned to its local task takes the high voltage transmission current and lowers its potential at a ratio of twenty or forty to one, for use in distribution and consumption circuits.
2300_131720_000005_000006 This evolution has been quite distinct, with its own inventors like Gaulard and Gibbs and Stanley, but came subsequent to the work of supplying small, dense areas of population; the art thus growing from within, and using each new gain as a means for further achievement.
2300_131720_000006_000001 Every department of mechanics was stimulated and benefited to an extraordinary degree.
2300_131720_000006_000002 Copper for the circuits was more highly refined than ever before to secure the best conductivity, and purity was insisted on in every kind of insulation. Edison was intolerant of sham and shoddy, and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope, test tube, and galvanometer.
2300_131720_000006_000004 He did not want his customers to count the heart beats of the engine in the flicker of the lamp.
2300_131720_000006_000005 Not a single engine was even within gunshot of the standard thus set up, but the emergency called forth its man in Gardiner c Sims, a talented draughtsman and designer who had been engaged in locomotive construction and in the engineering department of the United States Navy.
2300_131720_000007_000000 "Our first engine compelled the inventing and making of a suitable engine indicator to indicate it-the Tabor.
2300_131720_000007_000001 He obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake; also regulator of speed; but waited for an indicator to verify it.
2300_131720_000008_000001 We were at the machine works, Goerck Street.
2300_131720_000008_000003 It had been stepped on and flattened.
2300_131720_000008_000004 I took it up, and it had solved the engine oiling problem-and my walk to Lawrence like a tramp actor's was off!
2300_131720_000008_000005 The eccentric strap had a round glass oil cup with a brass base that screwed into the strap.
2300_131720_000008_000007 I requested him to make a sheet brass oil cup and solder it to the base I had.
2300_131720_000008_000008 He did so.
2300_131720_000008_000009 I then had a standard made to hold another oil cup, so as to see and regulate the drop feed.
2300_131720_000010_000004 The invention is in universal use today, alike for direct and for alternating current, and as well in the equipment of large buildings as in the distribution system of the most extensive central station networks.
2300_131720_000012_000000 The strong position held by the Edison system, under the strenuous competition that was already springing up, was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system; and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting.
2300_131720_000012_000001 Desiring to put this new system into practical use promptly, and receiving applications for licenses from all over the country, Edison selected brockton massachusetts, and Sunbury, Pennsylvania, as the two towns for the trial.
2300_131720_000012_000002 Of these two Brockton required the larger plant, but with the conductors placed underground. It was the first to complete its arrangements and close its contract. mr Henry Villard, it will be remembered, had married the daughter of Garrison, the famous abolitionist, and it was through his relationship with the Garrison family that Brockton came to have the honor of exemplifying so soon the principles of an entirely new art.
2300_131720_000013_000000 The Sunbury generating plant consisted of an Armington and Sims engine driving two small Edison dynamos having a total capacity of about four hundred lamps of sixteen c.p.
2300_131720_000013_000002 One ammeter, for measuring the quantity of current output, was interpolated in the "neutral bus" or third wire return circuit to indicate when the load on the two machines was out of balance.
2300_131720_000013_000007 The street conductors were of the overhead pole line construction, and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by Edison to build and equip central stations. A special type of street pole had been devised by him for the three wire system.
2300_131720_000015_000003 Meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wire system, known in England as the Hopkinson, both dr john Hopkinson and mr Edison being independent inventors at practically the same time.
2300_131720_000016_000002 About that time mr Andrews and I came together.
2300_131720_000016_000004 The electrical work had to be done in forty eight hours!
2300_131720_000016_000005 Having travelled around the world, I had cultivated an indifference to any special difficulties of that kind.
2300_131720_000016_000006 mr Andrews and I worked in collaboration until the night of the third.
2300_131720_000016_000008 I said we were sent over to get going, and insisted on starting up on the night of the third.
2300_131720_000016_000009 We had an Armington and Sims engine with sight feed oiler.
2300_131720_000016_000010 I had never seen one, and did not know how it worked, with the result that we soon burned up the babbitt metal in the bearings and spent a good part of the night getting them in order.
2300_131720_000016_000012 They found an engine somewhat loose in the bearings, and there followed remarks which would not look well in print.
2300_131720_000016_000013 Andrews skipped from under; he obeyed orders; I did not.
2300_131720_000016_000014 But the plant ran, and it was the first three wire station in this country."
2300_131720_000017_000001 The organization was crude, the steam engineering talent poor, and owing to the impossibility of getting any considerable capital subscribed, the plants were put in as cheaply as possible.
2300_131720_000017_000002 I believe that this construction department was unkindly named the 'Destruction Department.' It served its purpose; never made any money; and I had the unpleasant task of presiding at its obsequies."
2300_131720_000018_000000 On july fourth the Sunbury plant was put into commercial operation by Edison, and he remained a week studying its conditions and watching for any unforeseen difficulty that might arise.
2300_131720_000018_000001 Nothing happened, however, to interfere with the successful running of the station, and for twenty years thereafter the same two dynamos continued to furnish light in Sunbury.
2300_131720_000018_000002 They were later used as reserve machines, and finally, with the engine, retired from service as part of the "Collection of Edisonia"; but they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in eighteen eighty three.
2300_131720_000019_000000 Sunbury was also provided with the first electro chemical meters used in the United States outside New York City, so that it served also to accentuate electrical practice in a most vital respect-namely, the measurement of the electrical energy supplied to customers.
2300_131720_000019_000001 At this time and long after, all arc lighting was done on a "flat rate" basis.
2300_131720_000019_000002 The arc lamp installed outside a customer's premises, or in a circuit for public street lighting, burned so many hours nightly, so many nights in the month; and was paid for at that rate, subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident.
2300_131720_000019_000003 The early arc lamps were rated to require nine to ten amperes of current, at forty five volts pressure each, receiving which they were estimated to give two thousand c.p., which was arrived at by adding together the light found at four different positions, so that in reality the actual light was about five hundred c.p.
2300_131720_000019_000004 Few of these data were ever actually used, however; and it was all more or less a matter of guesswork, although the central station manager, aiming to give good service, would naturally see that the dynamos were so operated as to maintain as steadily as possible the normal potential and current.
2300_131720_000020_000001 It is true that even down to the present time the flat rate is applied to a great deal of incandescent lighting, each lamp being charged for individually according to its probable consumption during each month.
2300_131720_000020_000002 This may answer, perhaps, in a small place where the manager can gauge pretty closely from actual observation what each customer does; but even then there are elements of risk and waste; and obviously in a large city such a method would soon be likely to result in financial disaster to the plant.
2300_131720_000020_000003 Edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water, and he proceeded to develop a meter.
2300_131720_000020_000006 Edison, however, had satisfied himself that there were various ways of accomplishing the task, and had determined that the current should be measured on the premises of every consumer.
2300_131720_000020_000007 His electrolytic meter was very successful, and was of widespread use in America and in Europe until the perfection of mechanical meters by Elihu Thomson and others brought that type into general acceptance.
2300_131720_000020_000008 Hence the Edison electrolytic meter is no longer used, despite its excellent qualities.
2300_131720_000021_000001 When the lights or motors in the circuit are turned on, and a certain definite small portion of the current is diverted to flow through the meter, from the positive plate to the negative plate, the latter increases in weight by receiving a deposit of metallic zinc; the positive plate meantime losing in weight by the metal thus carried away from it.
2300_131720_000021_000006 The standard Edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination, another set being substituted. The meter was cheap to manufacture and install, and not at all liable to get out of order.
2300_131720_000022_000003 There was an average cost per lamp for meter operation of twenty two cents a year, and each meter took care of an average of seventeen lamps.
2300_131720_000023_000000 In this connection it should be mentioned that the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the Edison meter was accurate, and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights; and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter.
2300_131720_000023_000003 The meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine, and probably up to the close of the century.
2300_131720_000024_000002 He weighed and reweighed the meter plates, and pursued every line of investigation imaginable, but all in vain.
2300_131720_000024_000003 He felt he was up against it, and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better.
2300_131720_000024_000004 Once again he went to the customer's meter to look around, when a small piece of thick wire on the floor caught his eye. The problem was solved.
2300_131720_000025_000002 We put many customers on, but did not make out many bills.
2300_131720_000025_000005 To prevent these electrolytes from freezing we had in each meter a strip of metal.
2300_131720_000025_000006 When it got very cold the metal would contract and close a circuit, and throw a lamp into circuit inside the meter.
2300_131720_000025_000007 The heat from this lamp would prevent the liquid from freezing, so that the meter could go on doing its duty.
2300_131720_000025_000008 The first cold day after starting the station, people began to come in from their offices, especially down in Front Street and Water Street, saying the meter was on fire.
2300_131720_000026_000000 "After the station had been running several months and was technically a success, we began to look after the financial part.
2300_131720_000026_000001 We started to collect some bills; but we found that our books were kept badly, and that the person in charge, who was no business man, had neglected that part of it.
2300_131720_000026_000002 In fact, he did not know anything about the station, anyway. So I got the directors to permit me to hire a man to run the station. This was mr Chinnock, who was then superintendent of the Metropolitan Telephone Company of New York.
2300_131720_000026_000003 I knew Chinnock to be square and of good business ability, and induced him to leave his job.
2300_131720_000026_000004 I made him a personal guarantee, that if he would take hold of the station and put it on a commercial basis, and pay five per cent. on six hundred thousand dollars, I would give him ten thousand dollars out of my own pocket.
2300_131720_000026_000006 I might remark in this connection that years afterward I applied to the Edison Electric Light Company asking them if they would not like to pay me this money, as it was spent when I was very hard up and made the company a success, and was the foundation of their present prosperity.
2300_131720_000026_000007 They said they 'were sorry'--that is, 'Wall Street sorry'--and refused to pay it.
2300_131720_000027_000004 Of course the nights were getting longer.
2300_131720_000027_000006 Then the man called Chinnock up.
2300_131720_000028_000001 No, sir.
2300_131720_000030_000000 "In the second year we put the Stock Exchange on the circuits of the station, but were very fearful that there would be a combination of heavy demand and a dark day, and that there would be an overloaded station.
2300_131720_000030_000001 We had an index like a steam gauge, called an ampere meter, to indicate the amount of current going out.
2300_131720_000030_000003 A sudden black cloud came up, and I telephoned to Chinnock and asked him about the load.
2300_131720_000030_000005 I telephoned again, and felt something would happen, but fortunately it did not.
2300_131720_000032_000000 Returning to the more specific subject of pioneer plants of importance, that at Brockton must be considered for a moment, chiefly for the reason that the city was the first in the world to possess an Edison station distributing current through an underground three wire network of conductors-the essentially modern contemporaneous practice, standard twenty five years later.
2300_131720_000032_000004 Brockton had a good deal of pride in its fine trees, and a strong sentiment was very soon aroused against the mutilation proposed so thoughtlessly.
2300_131720_000032_000005 The investors in the enterprise were ready and anxious to meet the extra cost of putting the wires underground.
2300_131720_000033_000000 The station equipment at Brockton consisted at first of three dynamos, one of which was so arranged as to supply both sides of the system during light loads by a breakdown switch connection.
2300_131720_000033_000001 This arrangement interfered with correct meter registration, as the meters on one side of the system registered backward during the hours in which the combination was employed.
2300_131720_000033_000003 Soon after the station went into operation this ingenious plan was changed, and the third dynamo was replaced by two others.
2300_131720_000033_000004 The Edison construction department took entire charge of the installation of the plant, and the formal opening was attended on october first eighteen eighty three, by mr Edison, who then remained a week in ceaseless study and consultation over the conditions developed by this initial three wire underground plant.
2300_131720_000033_000005 Some idea of the confidence inspired by the fame of Edison at this period is shown by the fact that the first theatre ever lighted from a central station by incandescent lamps was designed this year, and opened in eighteen eighty four at Brockton with an equipment of three hundred lamps.
2300_131720_000033_000006 The theatre was never piped for gas! It was also from the Brockton central station that current was first supplied to a fire engine house-another display of remarkably early belief in the trustworthiness of the service, under conditions where continuity of lighting was vital.
2300_131720_000033_000008 It was at this central station that Lieutenant Sprague began his historic work on the electric motor; and here that another distinguished engineer and inventor, mr h Ward Leonard, installed the meters and became meter man, in order that he might study in every intimate detail the improvements and refinements necessary in that branch of the industry.
2300_131720_000034_000001 He had been connected with local telephone interests, but resigned to take active charge of this plant, imbibing quickly the traditional Edison spirit, working hard all day and sleeping in the station at night on a cot brought there for that purpose.
2300_131720_000034_000002 It was a time of uninterrupted watchfulness.
2300_131720_000034_000003 The difficulty of obtaining engineers in those days to run the high-speed engines (three hundred and fifty revolutions per minute) is well illustrated by an amusing incident in the very early history of the station.
2300_131720_000034_000005 One evening there came a sudden flash of fire and a spluttering, sizzling noise.
2300_131720_000034_000008 mr Sprague realized the trouble, quickly threw off the current and stopped the engine.
2300_131720_000035_000001 We then went to the dynamo room, where I pointed out the machines converting the steam power into electricity, appearing later in the form of light in the lamps.
2300_131720_000035_000002 After that they were shown the meters by which the consumption of current was measured.
2300_131720_000035_000003 They appeared to be interested, and I proceeded to enter upon a comparison of coal made into gas or burned under a boiler to be converted into electricity.
2300_131720_000035_000004 The ladies thanked me effusively and brought their visit to a close.
2300_131720_000037_000001 The Jury of Awards, in presenting four medals to the Edison company, took occasion to pay a high compliment to the efficiency of the system.
2300_131720_000037_000002 It has been thought by many that the magnificent success of this plant did more to stimulate the growth of the incandescent lighting business than any other event in the history of the Edison company.
2300_131720_000037_000003 It was literally the beginning of the electrical illumination of American Expositions, carried later to such splendid displays as those of the Chicago World's Fair in eighteen ninety three, Buffalo in nineteen o one, and saint Louis in nineteen o four.
2300_131720_000038_000000 Thus the art was set going in the United States under many difficulties, but with every sign of coming triumph.
2300_131720_000038_000001 Reference has already been made to the work abroad in Paris and London.
2300_131720_000038_000002 The first permanent Edison station in Europe was that at Milan, Italy, for which the order was given as early as May, eighteen eighty two, by an enterprising syndicate.
2300_131720_000038_000005 This pioneer system was operated continuously until february ninth nineteen hundred, or for a period of about seventeen years, when the sturdy old machines, still in excellent condition, were put out of service, so that a larger plant could be installed to meet the demand.
2300_131720_000038_000006 This new plant takes high tension polyphase current from a water power thirty or forty miles away at Paderno, on the river Adda, flowing from the Apennines; but delivers low tension direct current for distribution to the regular Edison three wire system throughout Milan.
2300_131720_000039_000003 We had no means of boring out the field magnets, and we cut grooves in them. I think the machine is still running (nineteen o seven).
2300_131720_000039_000005 With those eight dynamos we had four belts between each engine and the dynamo.
2300_131720_000039_000007 We had two wire underground feeders, sent without any plans or specifications for their installation.
2300_131720_000039_000008 The station had neither voltmeter nor ammeter.
2300_131720_000039_000010 We were using coal costing twelve dollars a ton, and were paid for our light in currency worth fifty cents on the dollar.
2300_131720_000040_000001 The station at Berlin comprised five boilers, and six vertical steam engines driving by belts twelve Edison dynamos, each of about fifty five horse power capacity.
2300_131720_000040_000002 A model of this station is preserved in the Deutschen Museum at Munich.
2300_131720_000040_000004 The International Electrical Exposition at Paris was intended to place before the eyes of the civilized world the achievements of the century.
2300_131720_000040_000005 Among the exhibits of that Exposition was the Edison system of incandescent lighting.
2300_131720_000040_000006 IT BECAME THE BASIS OF MODERN HEAVY CURRENT TECHNICS." The last phrase is italicized as being a happy and authoritative description, as well as a tribute.
2300_131720_000041_000001 Note has already been made of the first Edison plants afloat on the Jeannette and Columbia, and the first commercial plant in the New York lithographic establishment.
2300_131720_000041_000002 The first mill plant was placed in the woollen factory of james Harrison at Newburgh, New York, about september fifteenth eighteen eighty one.
2300_131720_000042_000000 The first Edison plant in a hotel was started in October, eighteen eighty one, at the Blue Mountain House in the Adirondacks, and consisted of two "Z" dynamos with a complement of eight and sixteen candle lamps.
2300_131720_000042_000001 The hotel is situated at an elevation of thirty five hundred feet above the sea, and was at that time forty miles from the railroad.
2300_131720_000042_000002 The machinery was taken up in pieces on the backs of mules from the foot of the mountain.
2300_131720_000042_000003 The boilers were fired by wood, as the economical transportation of coal was a physical impossibility.
2300_131720_000042_000004 For a six hour run of the plant one quarter of a cord of wood was required, at a cost of twenty five cents per cord.
2300_131720_000043_000001 The installation of boilers, engines, dynamos, wiring, switches, fixtures, three stage regulators, and six hundred and fifty lamps, was completed in eleven days after receipt of the order, and the plant was successfully operated at the opening of the theatre, on december twelfth eighteen eighty two.
2300_131720_000044_000001 The most interesting feature of this installation was the employment of special deep-sea lamps, supplied with current through a cable nine hundred and forty feet in length, for the purpose of alluring fish.
237_126133_000001_000000 POLLY IS COMFORTED
237_126133_000002_000000 Yes, it must be confessed.
237_126133_000002_000003 At night, when no one knew it, the tears would come racing over the poor, forlorn little face, and would not be squeezed back.
237_126133_000002_000004 It got to be noticed finally; and one and all redoubled their exertions to make everything twice as pleasant as ever!
237_126133_000003_000000 The only place, except in front of the grand piano, where Polly approached a state of comparative happiness, was in the greenhouse.
237_126133_000004_000000 Here she would stay, comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics, rejoicing the heart of Old Turner the gardener, who since Polly's first rapturous entrance, had taken her into his good graces for all time.
237_126133_000005_000000 Every chance she could steal after practice hours were over, and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied, was seized to fly on the wings of the wind, to the flowers.
237_126133_000007_000001 "Then, dear," said mrs Whitney, "you must be kinder to her than ever; think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends."
237_126133_000008_000000 "I'd like it first rate to be away from Percy," said Van, reflectively; "I wouldn't come back in three, no, six weeks."
237_126133_000009_000000 "My son," said his mamma, "just stop and think how badly you would feel, if you really couldn't see Percy."
237_126133_000010_000000 "Well," said Van, and he showed signs of relenting a little at that; "but Percy is perfectly awful, mamma, you don't know; and he feels so smart too," he said vindictively.
237_126133_000011_000000 "Well," said mrs Whitney, softly, "let's think what we can do for Polly; it makes me feel very badly to see her sad little face."
237_126133_000012_000000 "I don't know," said Van, running over in his mind all the possible ways he could think of for entertaining anybody, "unless she'd like my new book of travels-or my velocipede," he added.
237_126133_000013_000000 "I'm afraid those wouldn't quite answer the purpose," said his mamma, smiling-"especially the last; yet we must think of something."
237_126133_000014_000000 But just here mr King thought it about time to take matters into his hands.
237_126133_000014_000001 So, with a great many chucklings and shruggings when no one was by, he had departed after breakfast one day, simply saying he shouldn't be back to lunch.
237_126133_000015_000001 Somehow, of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest, this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer.
237_126133_000015_000002 If she could only see Phronsie for just one moment!
237_126133_000015_000003 "I shall have to give up!" she moaned.
237_126133_000015_000004 "I can't bear it!" and over went her head on the music rack.
237_126133_000016_000000 "Where is she?" said a voice over in front of the piano, in the gathering dusk-unmistakably mr King's.
237_126133_000017_000001 "She must be there now, somewhere," and then somebody laughed.
237_126133_000019_000000 Polly sat up very straight, and whisked off the tears quickly.
237_126133_000020_000000 "Here, Polly, hold your arms," he had only strength to gasp.
237_126133_000021_000000 At this, the bundle opened suddenly, and-out popped Phronsie!
237_126133_000022_000000 "Here I'm!
237_126133_000022_000001 I'm here, Polly!"
237_126133_000023_000000 But Polly couldn't speak; and if Jasper hadn't caught her just in time, she would have tumbled over backward from the stool, Phronsie and all!
237_126133_000024_000000 "Aren't you glad I've come, Polly?" asked Phronsie, with her little face close to Polly's own.
237_126133_000025_000000 That brought Polly to.
237_126133_000025_000001 "Oh, Phronsie!" she cried, and strained her to her heart; while the boys crowded around, and plied her with sudden questions.
237_126133_000026_000000 "Now you'll stay," cried Van; "say, Polly, won't you."
237_126133_000027_000000 "Weren't you awfully surprised?" cried Percy; "say, Polly, awfully?"
237_126133_000028_000000 "Is her name Phronsie," put in Dick, unwilling to be left out, and not thinking of anything else to ask.
237_126133_000029_000000 "Boys," whispered their mother, warningly, "she can't answer you; just look at her face."
237_126133_000030_000000 And to be sure, our Polly's face was a study to behold.
237_126133_000031_000000 "Oh!" she cried, coming out of her rapture a little, and springing over to mr King with Phronsie still in her arms.
237_126133_000032_000000 "Isn't he splendid!" cried Jasper in intense pride, swelling up.
237_126133_000032_000001 "Father knew how to do it."
237_126133_000033_000000 But Polly's arms were around the old gentleman's neck, so she didn't hear.
237_126133_000033_000001 "There, there," he said soothingly, patting her brown, fuzzy head. Something was going down the old gentleman's neck, that wet his collar, and made him whisper very tenderly in her ear, "don't give way now, Polly; Phronsie'll see you."
237_126133_000034_000000 "I know," gasped Polly, controlling her sobs; "I won't-only-I can't thank you!"
237_126133_000035_000000 "Phronsie," said Jasper quickly, "what do you suppose Prince said the other day?"
237_126133_000036_000000 "What?" asked Phronsie in intense interest slipping down out of Polly's arms, and crowding up close to Jasper's side.
237_126133_000037_000000 "Oh ho, how funny!" laughed Van, while little Dick burst right out, "Japser!"
237_126133_000038_000000 "Be still," said Jappy warningly, while Phronsie stood surveying them all with grave eyes.
237_126133_000039_000001 Bark!'"
237_126133_000041_000000 "Yes, all alone by himself," asserted Jasper, vehemently, and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing; "he did now, truly, Phronsie."
237_126133_000042_000001 yes, pretty soon now?"
237_126133_000043_000000 "So you must," cried Jasper, enchanted at his success in amusing; "and I'll go with you."
237_126133_000046_000000 "Oh Phronsie!" cried Polly, turning around at the last words; "how could you!"
237_126133_000047_000000 "Don't mind it, Polly," whispered Jasper; "twasn't her fault."
237_126133_000048_000000 "Phronsie," said mrs Whitney, smilingly, stooping over the child, "would you like to see a little pussy I have for you?"
237_126133_000049_000000 But the chubby face didn't look up brightly, as usual: and the next moment, without a bit of warning, Phronsie sprang past them all, even Polly, and flung herself into mr King's arms, in a perfect torrent of sobs.
237_126133_000049_000001 "Oh! let's go back!" was all they heard!
237_126133_000050_000000 "Dear me!" ejaculated the old gentleman, in the utmost amazement; "and such a time as I've had to get her here too!" he added, staring around on the astonished group, none of whom had a word to say.
237_126133_000051_000000 But Polly stood like a statue!
237_126133_000051_000001 All Jasper's frantic efforts at comfort, utterly failed.
237_126133_000051_000002 To think that Phronsie had left her for any one!--even good mr King!
237_126133_000054_000000 "She's the cunningest little thing I ever saw," said mrs Whitney, enthusiastically, afterward, aside to mr King.
237_126133_000055_000000 "I didn't have any fears, if I worked it rightly," said the old gentleman complacently.
237_126133_000055_000001 "I wasn't coming without her, Marian, if it could possibly be managed.
237_126133_000055_000003 "So you see, I was just in time; in the very nick of time, in fact!"
237_126133_000056_000000 "So her mother was willing?" asked his daughter, curiously.
237_126133_000056_000001 "Oh, she couldn't help it," cried mr King, beginning to walk up and down the floor, and beaming as he recalled his successful strategy; "there wasn't the smallest use in thinking of anything else.
237_126133_000056_000003 At last he came out of them, and wiped his face vigorously.
237_126133_000057_000000 "And to think how fond the little girl is of you, father!" said mrs Whitney, who hadn't yet gotten over her extreme surprise at the old gentleman's complete subjection to the little Peppers: he, whom all children had by instinct always approached so carefully, and whom every one found it necessary to conciliate!
237_126133_000058_000000 "Well, she's a nice child," he said, "a very nice child; and," straightening himself up to his fullest height, and looking so very handsome, that his daughter could not conceal her admiration, "I shall always take care of Phronsie Pepper, Marian!"
237_126133_000059_000000 "So I hope," said mrs Whitney; "and father, I do believe they'll repay you; for I do think there's good blood there; these children have a look about them that shows them worthy to be trusted."
237_126133_000060_000000 "So they have: so they have," assented mr King, and then the conversation dropped.
237_134493_000000_000001 Neighboring Fields
237_134493_000002_000001 His wife now lies beside him, and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields.
237_134493_000002_000002 Could he rise from beneath it, he would not know the country under which he has been asleep.
237_134493_000002_000003 The shaggy coat of the prairie, which they lifted to make him a bed, has vanished forever.
237_134493_000002_000004 From the Norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checker board, marked off in squares of wheat and corn; light and dark, dark and light.
237_134493_000002_000005 Telephone wires hum along the white roads, which always run at right angles.
237_134493_000002_000006 From the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gayly painted farmhouses; the gilded weather vanes on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields.
237_134493_000003_000000 The Divide is now thickly populated.
237_134493_000003_000001 The rich soil yields heavy harvests; the dry, bracing climate and the smoothness of the land make labor easy for men and beasts.
237_134493_000003_000003 The wheat cutting sometimes goes on all night as well as all day, and in good seasons there are scarcely men and horses enough to do the harvesting.
237_134493_000003_000004 The grain is so heavy that it bends toward the blade and cuts like velvet.
237_134493_000004_000001 It gives itself ungrudgingly to the moods of the season, holding nothing back.
237_134493_000004_000002 Like the plains of Lombardy, it seems to rise a little to meet the sun
237_134493_000004_000003 The air and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled, as if the one were the breath of the other.
237_134493_000005_000000 One June morning a young man stood at the gate of the Norwegian graveyard, sharpening his scythe in strokes unconsciously timed to the tune he was whistling.
237_134493_000005_000001 He wore a flannel cap and duck trousers, and the sleeves of his white flannel shirt were rolled back to the elbow.
237_134493_000005_000003 Unconscious respect, probably, for he seemed intent upon his own thoughts, and, like the Gladiator's, they were far away.
237_134493_000005_000004 He was a splendid figure of a boy, tall and straight as a young pine tree, with a handsome head, and stormy gray eyes, deeply set under a serious brow.
237_134493_000005_000005 The space between his two front teeth, which were unusually far apart, gave him the proficiency in whistling for which he was distinguished at college. (He also played the cornet in the University band.)
237_134493_000006_000000 When the grass required his close attention, or when he had to stoop to cut about a head stone, he paused in his lively air,--the "Jewel" song,--taking it up where he had left it when his scythe swung free again.
237_134493_000006_000001 He was not thinking about the tired pioneers over whom his blade glittered.
237_134493_000006_000002 The old wild country, the struggle in which his sister was destined to succeed while so many men broke their hearts and died, he can scarcely remember.
237_134493_000006_000003 That is all among the dim things of childhood and has been forgotten in the brighter pattern life weaves to day, in the bright facts of being captain of the track team, and holding the interstate record for the high jump, in the all suffusing brightness of being twenty one.
237_134493_000006_000004 Yet sometimes, in the pauses of his work, the young man frowned and looked at the ground with an intentness which suggested that even twenty one might have its problems.
237_134493_000007_000000 When he had been mowing the better part of an hour, he heard the rattle of a light cart on the road behind him.
237_134493_000007_000001 Supposing that it was his sister coming back from one of her farms, he kept on with his work.
237_134493_000007_000002 The cart stopped at the gate and a merry contralto voice called, "Almost through, Emil?" He dropped his scythe and went toward the fence, wiping his face and neck with his handkerchief. In the cart sat a young woman who wore driving gauntlets and a wide shade hat, trimmed with red poppies.
237_134493_000007_000003 Her face, too, was rather like a poppy, round and brown, with rich color in her cheeks and lips, and her dancing yellow brown eyes bubbled with gayety.
237_134493_000007_000004 The wind was flapping her big hat and teasing a curl of her chestnut colored hair.
237_134493_000007_000005 She shook her head at the tall youth.
237_134493_000008_000000 "What time did you get over here?
237_134493_000008_000001 That's not much of a job for an athlete.
237_134493_000008_000002 Here I've been to town and back.
237_134493_000008_000003 Alexandra lets you sleep late.
237_134493_000008_000005 Lou's wife was telling me about the way she spoils you.
237_134493_000008_000006 I was going to give you a lift, if you were done." She gathered up her reins.
237_134493_000009_000000 "But I will be, in a minute.
237_134493_000009_000001 Please wait for me, Marie," Emil coaxed.
237_134493_000009_000002 "Alexandra sent me to mow our lot, but I've done half a dozen others, you see.
237_134493_000009_000003 Just wait till I finish off the Kourdnas'. By the way, they were Bohemians.
237_134493_000009_000004 Why aren't they up in the Catholic graveyard?"
237_134493_000010_000000 "Free thinkers," replied the young woman laconically.
237_134493_000011_000000 "Lots of the Bohemian boys at the University are," said Emil, taking up his scythe again.
237_134493_000011_000002 They still jaw about it in history classes."
237_134493_000012_000000 "We'd do it right over again, most of us," said the young woman hotly.
237_134493_000013_000001 "Oh, there's no denying you're a spunky little bunch, you Czechs," he called back over his shoulder.
237_134493_000014_000000 Marie Shabata settled herself in her seat and watched the rhythmical movement of the young man's long arms, swinging her foot as if in time to some air that was going through her mind.
237_134493_000014_000003 She sat with the ease that belongs to persons of an essentially happy nature, who can find a comfortable spot almost anywhere; who are supple, and quick in adapting themselves to circumstances.
237_134493_000014_000005 "I gave old man Lee a cut or so, too.
237_134493_000014_000006 Lou's wife needn't talk.
237_134493_000015_000000 Marie clucked to her horse.
237_134493_000015_000001 "Oh, you know Annie!" She looked at the young man's bare arms.
237_134493_000015_000002 "How brown you've got since you came home.
237_134493_000015_000003 I wish I had an athlete to mow my orchard.
237_134493_000015_000004 I get wet to my knees when I go down to pick cherries."
237_134493_000017_000000 "Will you?
237_134493_000017_000001 Oh, there's a good boy!" She turned her head to him with a quick, bright smile.
237_134493_000017_000002 He felt it rather than saw it.
237_134493_000017_000003 Indeed, he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it.
237_134493_000017_000004 "I've been up looking at Angelique's wedding clothes," Marie went on, "and I'm so excited I can hardly wait until Sunday.
237_134493_000017_000005 Amedee will be a handsome bridegroom.
237_134493_000017_000006 Is anybody but you going to stand up with him?
237_134493_000017_000009 Maybe the supper will tempt him.
237_134493_000017_000010 All Angelique's folks are baking for it, and all Amedee's twenty cousins.
237_134493_000017_000011 There will be barrels of beer.
237_134493_000017_000012 If once I get Frank to the supper, I'll see that I stay for the dance.
237_134493_000017_000014 You must dance with all the French girls.
237_134493_000017_000015 It hurts their feelings if you don't.
237_134493_000017_000016 They think you're proud because you've been away to school or something."
237_134493_000018_000001 "How do you know they think that?"
237_134493_000021_000000 They drove westward toward Norway Creek, and toward a big white house that stood on a hill, several miles across the fields.
237_134493_000021_000001 There were so many sheds and outbuildings grouped about it that the place looked not unlike a tiny village.
237_134493_000021_000002 A stranger, approaching it, could not help noticing the beauty and fruitfulness of the outlying fields.
237_134493_000021_000003 There was something individual about the great farm, a most unusual trimness and care for detail.
237_134493_000021_000004 On either side of the road, for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill, stood tall osage orange hedges, their glossy green marking off the yellow fields.
237_134493_000021_000006 Any one thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the Divide, and that the farmer was a woman, Alexandra Bergson.
237_134493_000022_000000 If you go up the hill and enter Alexandra's big house, you will find that it is curiously unfinished and uneven in comfort.
237_134493_000022_000001 One room is papered, carpeted, over furnished; the next is almost bare.
237_134493_000022_000002 The pleasantest rooms in the house are the kitchen-where Alexandra's three young Swedish girls chatter and cook and pickle and preserve all summer long-and the sitting room, in which Alexandra has brought together the old homely furniture that the Bergsons used in their first log house, the family portraits, and the few things her mother brought from Sweden.
237_134493_000023_000000 When you go out of the house into the flower garden, there you feel again the order and fine arrangement manifest all over the great farm; in the fencing and hedging, in the windbreaks and sheds, in the symmetrical pasture ponds, planted with scrub willows to give shade to the cattle in fly time.
237_134493_000023_000001 There is even a white row of beehives in the orchard, under the walnut trees.
237_134493_000023_000002 You feel that, properly, Alexandra's house is the big out of doors, and that it is in the soil that she expresses herself best.
237_134500_000001_000000 On the evening of the day of Alexandra's call at the Shabatas', a heavy rain set in.
237_134500_000001_000001 Frank sat up until a late hour reading the Sunday newspapers.
237_134500_000001_000002 One of the Goulds was getting a divorce, and Frank took it as a personal affront.
237_134500_000001_000003 In printing the story of the young man's marital troubles, the knowing editor gave a sufficiently colored account of his career, stating the amount of his income and the manner in which he was supposed to spend it.
237_134500_000001_000004 Frank read English slowly, and the more he read about this divorce case, the angrier he grew.
237_134500_000001_000006 He turned to his farm hand who was reading the other half of the paper.
237_134500_000002_000001 Listen here what he do wit his money." And Frank began the catalogue of the young man's reputed extravagances.
237_134500_000003_000001 She thought it hard that the Goulds, for whom she had nothing but good will, should make her so much trouble.
237_134500_000003_000002 She hated to see the Sunday newspapers come into the house.
237_134500_000003_000003 Frank was always reading about the doings of rich people and feeling outraged. He had an inexhaustible stock of stories about their crimes and follies, how they bribed the courts and shot down their butlers with impunity whenever they chose.
237_134500_000003_000004 Frank and Lou Bergson had very similar ideas, and they were two of the political agitators of the county.
237_134500_000004_000001 After he was gone, Marie went out to the back porch to begin her butter making. A brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky.
237_134500_000004_000002 The orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
237_134500_000004_000004 That invitation decided her.
237_134500_000004_000005 She ran into the house, put on a short skirt and a pair of her husband's boots, caught up a tin pail and started for the orchard.
237_134500_000004_000006 Emil had already begun work and was mowing vigorously.
237_134500_000004_000007 When he saw her coming, he stopped and wiped his brow.
237_134500_000004_000008 His yellow canvas leggings and khaki trousers were splashed to the knees.
237_134500_000005_000000 "Don't let me disturb you, Emil.
237_134500_000005_000001 I'm going to pick cherries. Isn't everything beautiful after the rain?
237_134500_000005_000002 Oh, but I'm glad to get this place mowed!
237_134500_000005_000003 When I heard it raining in the night, I thought maybe you would come and do it for me to day.
237_134500_000005_000004 The wind wakened me.
237_134500_000005_000005 Didn't it blow dreadfully?
237_134500_000005_000006 Just smell the wild roses!
237_134500_000005_000007 They are always so spicy after a rain.
237_134500_000005_000008 We never had so many of them in here before.
237_134500_000005_000009 I suppose it's the wet season.
237_134500_000005_000010 Will you have to cut them, too?"
237_134500_000006_000000 "If I cut the grass, I will," Emil said teasingly.
237_134500_000006_000002 What makes you so flighty?"
237_134500_000007_000000 "Am I flighty?
237_134500_000007_000001 I suppose that's the wet season, too, then.
237_134500_000007_000002 It's exciting to see everything growing so fast,--and to get the grass cut!
237_134500_000007_000003 Please leave the roses till last, if you must cut them.
237_134500_000007_000004 Oh, I don't mean all of them, I mean that low place down by my tree, where there are so many.
237_134500_000007_000005 Aren't you splashed!
237_134500_000007_000006 Look at the spider webs all over the grass.
237_134500_000007_000007 Good bye.
237_134500_000007_000008 I'll call you if I see a snake."
237_134500_000008_000001 In a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pail, and he began to swing his scythe with that long, even stroke that few American boys ever learn.
237_134500_000009_000000 That summer the rains had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than Shabata and his man could do to keep up with the corn; the orchard was a neglected wilderness.
237_134500_000009_000001 All sorts of weeds and herbs and flowers had grown up there; splotches of wild larkspur, pale green and white spikes of hoarhound, plantations of wild cotton, tangles of foxtail and wild wheat.
237_134500_000009_000002 South of the apricot trees, cornering on the wheatfield, was Frank's alfalfa, where myriads of white and yellow butterflies were always fluttering above the purple blossoms.
237_134500_000009_000003 When Emil reached the lower corner by the hedge, Marie was sitting under her white mulberry tree, the pailful of cherries beside her, looking off at the gentle, tireless swelling of the wheat.
237_134500_000011_000000 Emil paused and straightened his back.
237_134500_000011_000001 "I don't know.
237_134500_000011_000002 About like the Germans', wasn't it?"
237_134500_000012_000000 Marie went on as if she had not heard him.
237_134500_000013_000001 "Do they?
237_134500_000013_000002 Well, which are the lucky trees? I'd like to know."
237_134500_000014_000000 "I don't know all of them, but I know lindens are.
237_134500_000014_000001 The old people in the mountains plant lindens to purify the forest, and to do away with the spells that come from the old trees they say have lasted from heathen times.
237_134500_000014_000002 I'm a good Catholic, but I think I could get along with caring for trees, if I hadn't anything else."
237_134500_000015_000000 "That's a poor saying," said Emil, stooping over to wipe his hands in the wet grass.
237_134500_000016_000000 "Why is it?
237_134500_000016_000001 If I feel that way, I feel that way.
237_134500_000016_000002 I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than other things do.
237_134500_000016_000003 I feel as if this tree knows everything I ever think of when I sit here.
237_134500_000017_000000 Emil had nothing to say to this.
237_134500_000017_000001 He reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet, insipid fruit,--long ivory colored berries, tipped with faint pink, like white coral, that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through.
237_134500_000017_000002 He dropped a handful into her lap.
237_134500_000018_000000 "Do you like mr Linstrum?" Marie asked suddenly.
237_134500_000019_000000 "Yes.
237_134500_000019_000001 Don't you?"
237_134500_000020_000000 "Oh, ever so much; only he seems kind of staid and school teachery. But, of course, he is older than Frank, even.
237_134500_000020_000002 Do you think Alexandra likes him very much?"
237_134500_000021_000001 They were old friends."
237_134500_000022_000000 "Oh, Emil, you know what I mean!" Marie tossed her head impatiently. "Does she really care about him?
237_134500_000022_000001 When she used to tell me about him, I always wondered whether she wasn't a little in love with him."
237_134500_000023_000000 "Who, Alexandra?" Emil laughed and thrust his hands into his trousers pockets.
237_134500_000023_000001 "Alexandra's never been in love, you crazy!" He laughed again.
237_134500_000023_000002 "She wouldn't know how to go about it.
237_134500_000023_000003 The idea!"
237_134500_000024_000000 Marie shrugged her shoulders.
237_134500_000024_000001 "Oh, you don't know Alexandra as well as you think you do!
237_134500_000024_000002 If you had any eyes, you would see that she is very fond of him.
237_134500_000024_000003 It would serve you all right if she walked off with Carl.
237_134500_000024_000004 I like him because he appreciates her more than you do."
237_134500_000025_000001 "What are you talking about, Marie?
237_134500_000025_000003 She and I have always been good friends.
237_134500_000025_000004 What more do you want?
237_134500_000025_000005 I like to talk to Carl about New York and what a fellow can do there."
237_134500_000026_000000 "Oh, Emil!
237_134500_000026_000001 Surely you are not thinking of going off there?"
237_134500_000027_000000 "Why not?
237_134500_000027_000001 I must go somewhere, mustn't I?"
237_134500_000027_000003 "Would you rather I went off in the sand hills and lived like Ivar?"
237_134500_000028_000000 Marie's face fell under his brooding gaze.
237_134500_000028_000001 She looked down at his wet leggings.
237_134500_000028_000002 "I'm sure Alexandra hopes you will stay on here," she murmured.
237_134500_000029_000001 Alexandra can run the farm all right, without me.
237_134500_000029_000003 I want to be doing something on my own account."
237_134500_000030_000000 "That's so," Marie sighed.
237_134500_000030_000002 Almost anything you choose."
237_134500_000031_000000 "And there are so many, many things I can't do." Emil echoed her tone sarcastically.
237_134500_000031_000001 "Sometimes I don't want to do anything at all, and sometimes I want to pull the four corners of the Divide together,"--he threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerk,--"so, like a table cloth.
237_134500_000031_000002 I get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down, up and down."
237_134500_000032_000000 Marie looked up at his defiant figure and her face clouded.
237_134500_000032_000001 "I wish you weren't so restless, and didn't get so worked up over things," she said sadly.
237_134500_000033_000000 "Thank you," he returned shortly.
237_134500_000034_000000 She sighed despondently.
237_134500_000034_000001 "Everything I say makes you cross, don't it?
237_134500_000034_000002 And you never used to be cross to me."
237_134500_000035_000000 Emil took a step nearer and stood frowning down at her bent head. He stood in an attitude of self defense, his feet well apart, his hands clenched and drawn up at his sides, so that the cords stood out on his bare arms.
237_134500_000035_000001 "I can't play with you like a little boy any more," he said slowly.
237_134500_000035_000002 "That's what you miss, Marie.
237_134500_000035_000003 You'll have to get some other little boy to play with." He stopped and took a deep breath.
237_134500_000035_000004 Then he went on in a low tone, so intense that it was almost threatening: "Sometimes you seem to understand perfectly, and then sometimes you pretend you don't.
237_134500_000035_000005 You don't help things any by pretending.
237_134500_000035_000006 It's then that I want to pull the corners of the Divide together.
237_134500_000035_000007 If you WON'T understand, you know, I could make you!"
237_134500_000036_000000 Marie clasped her hands and started up from her seat.
237_134500_000036_000001 She had grown very pale and her eyes were shining with excitement and distress. "But, Emil, if I understand, then all our good times are over, we can never do nice things together any more.
237_134500_000036_000002 We shall have to behave like mr Linstrum.
237_134500_000036_000003 And, anyhow, there's nothing to understand!" She struck the ground with her little foot fiercely.
237_134500_000036_000004 "That won't last.
237_134500_000036_000005 It will go away, and things will be just as they used to. I wish you were a Catholic.
237_134500_000036_000006 The Church helps people, indeed it does.
237_134500_000036_000007 I pray for you, but that's not the same as if you prayed yourself."
237_134500_000037_000001 Emil stood defiant, gazing down at her.
237_134500_000038_000000 "I can't pray to have the things I want," he said slowly, "and I won't pray not to have them, not if I'm damned for it."
237_134500_000039_000000 Marie turned away, wringing her hands.
237_134500_000040_000000 "Yes; over.
237_134500_000040_000001 I never expect to have any more."
237_134500_000041_000000 Emil gripped the hand holds of his scythe and began to mow.
237_134500_000041_000001 Marie took up her cherries and went slowly toward the house, crying bitterly.
2414_128291_000008_000000 Except we be converted and become as kine, we shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
2414_128291_000008_000001 For we ought to learn from them one thing: ruminating.
2414_128291_000009_000000 And verily, although a man should gain the whole world, and yet not learn one thing, ruminating, what would it profit him!
2414_128291_000009_000001 He would not be rid of his affliction,
2414_128291_000010_000000 --His great affliction: that, however, is at present called DISGUST.
2414_128291_000010_000002 Thou also!
2414_128291_000011_000001 "Who is this with whom I talk?" he exclaimed frightened, and sprang up from the ground.
2414_128291_000015_000000 --Who was ashamed of his riches and of the rich, and fled to the poorest to bestow upon them his abundance and his heart?
2414_128291_000015_000001 But they received him not."
2414_128291_000016_000000 "But they received me not," said the voluntary beggar, "thou knowest it, forsooth.
2414_128291_000025_000000 --At the culprits of riches, with cold eyes and rank thoughts, who pick up profit out of all kinds of rubbish-at this rabble that stinketh to heaven,
2414_128291_000036_000000 Behold, thither leadeth the way to my cave: be to night its guest.
2414_128292_000001_000000 My shadow calleth me?
2414_128292_000001_000001 What matter about my shadow!
2414_128292_000003_000000 "What!" said he, "have not the most ludicrous things always happened to us old anchorites and saints?
2414_128292_000010_000000 What?
2414_128292_000010_000001 Must I ever be on the way?
2414_128292_000013_000000 With thee have I wandered about in the remotest, coldest worlds, like a phantom that voluntarily haunteth winter roofs and snows.
2414_128292_000016_000002 It is also skin.
2414_128292_000016_000003 The devil himself is perhaps-skin.
2414_128292_000017_000000 'Nothing is true, all is permitted': so said I to myself.
2414_128292_000017_000002 Ah, how oft did I stand there naked on that account, like a red crab!
2414_128292_000018_000000 Ah, where have gone all my goodness and all my shame and all my belief in the good!
2414_128292_000022_000001 A haven towards which MY sail is set?
2414_128292_000024_000000 What still remaineth to me?
2414_128292_000027_000000 Thus spake the shadow, and Zarathustra's countenance lengthened at his words.
2414_128292_000030_000000 Beware lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee, a hard, rigorous delusion!
2414_128292_000031_000000 Thou hast lost thy goal.
2414_128292_000031_000001 Alas, how wilt thou forego and forget that loss?
2414_159411_000003_000000 So the Brahman and the Tiger walked on till they came to a Banyan tree; and the Brahman said to it: "Banyan Tree, Banyan Tree, hear and give judgment." "On what must I give judgment?" asked the Banyan Tree.
2414_159411_000004_000001 Let the Tiger eat the man, for men are an ungrateful race."
2414_159411_000005_000001 After a little while they met a camel.
2414_159411_000007_000001 At a little distance they found a bullock lying by the roadside.
2414_159411_000007_000004 Is it fair that he should do so or not?"
2414_159411_000007_000005 The Bullock said: "When I was able to work my master fed me well and tended me carefully, but now I am old he has forgotten all I did for him, and left me by the roadside to die.
2414_159411_000007_000006 Let the Tiger eat the man, for men have no pity."
2414_159411_000009_000001 The Brahman stated the case, and the Eagle answered: "Whenever men see me they try to shoot me; they climb the rocks and steal away my little ones.
2414_159411_000009_000002 Let the Tiger eat the man, for men are the persecutors of the earth."
2414_159411_000010_000001 But the Alligator said: "Whenever I put my nose out of the water men torment me and try to kill me.
2414_159411_000011_000000 The Brahman gave himself up as lost; but again he prayed the Tiger to have patience and let him ask the opinion of the sixth judge.
2414_159411_000011_000005 "Exactly there, was it?" asked the Jackal.
2414_159411_000011_000008 "How do you mean?" said the Jackal; "how were you within the cage? which way were you looking?" "Why, I stood so," said the Tiger, jumping into the cage, "and my head was on this side." "Very good," said the Jackal, "but I cannot judge without understanding the whole matter exactly.
2414_159411_000011_000009 Was the cage door open or shut?" "Shut and bolted," said the Brahman.

2609_156975_000026_000001 Furthermore, the Egyptian historians never distinguished the different races in their midst, but rather designated the foreign serf class by a common name.
2609_156975_000027_000000 The Biblical narratives apparently disagree regarding the duration of the sojourn in Egypt.
2609_156975_000027_000003 The later traditions tend to extend the period.
2609_156975_000027_000009 The excavations also laid bare a great square brick wall with the ruins of store chambers inside.

2609_156975_000035_000003 This conclusion is possible and in many ways attractive, but it is beset with serious difficulties.
2609_156975_000035_000006 Do the earliest Hebrew traditions imply that the ancestors of the Israelites were worshippers of Jehovah?
2609_156975_000036_000004 The cruel fate of his people and the painful experience in Egypt that had driven him into the wilderness prepared his mind to receive this training.
2609_157645_000010_000000 Blackburn, Archbishop of York, was a great smoker.

2609_169640_000013_000011 The question was, now, whether we could pass them or not before they got near enough to grapple.
2609_169640_000013_000013 The captain behaved perfectly well in this critical instant, commanding a dead silence, and the closest attention to his orders.

260_123286_000001_000000 CHAPTER thirty three.
260_123286_000002_000000 A BATTLE OF MONSTERS
260_123286_000003_000002 The horizon seems extremely distant.
260_123286_000004_000000 My head is still stupefied with the vivid reality of my dream.
260_123286_000005_000000 My uncle has had no dreams, but he is out of temper.
260_123286_000005_000001 He examines the horizon all round with his glass, and folds his arms with the air of an injured man.
260_123286_000006_000002 And yet, what cause was there for anger?
260_123286_000006_000004 Is not the raft spinning along with marvellous speed?
260_123286_000007_000000 "-You seem anxious, my uncle," I said, seeing him continually with his glass to his eye.
260_123286_000008_000001 No, not at all."
260_123286_000009_000000 "Impatient, then?"
260_123286_000010_000000 "One might be, with less reason than now."
260_123286_000011_000000 "Yet we are going very fast."
260_123286_000012_000000 "What does that signify?
260_123286_000012_000001 I am not complaining that the rate is slow, but that the sea is so wide."
260_123286_000013_000000 I then remembered that the Professor, before starting, had estimated the length of this underground sea at thirty leagues.
260_123286_000014_000000 "We are not descending as we ought to be," the Professor declares. "We are losing time, and the fact is, I have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft."
260_123286_000016_000000 "But," I remarked, "since we have followed the road that Saknussemm has shown us-"
260_123286_000017_000000 "That is just the question.
260_123286_000017_000001 Have we followed that road?
260_123286_000017_000003 Did he cross it?
260_123286_000018_000000 "At any rate we cannot feel sorry to have come so far.
260_123286_000019_000000 "But I don't care for prospects.
260_123286_000019_000001 I came with an object, and I mean to attain it.
260_123286_000019_000002 Therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects."
260_123286_000020_000000 I take this as my answer, and I leave the Professor to bite his lips with impatience.
260_123286_000021_000002 Weather unchanged.
260_123286_000021_000003 The wind freshens.
260_123286_000021_000004 On awaking, my first thought was to observe the intensity of the light.
260_123286_000021_000005 I was possessed with an apprehension lest the electric light should grow dim, or fail altogether.
260_123286_000021_000007 The shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves.
260_123286_000022_000001 It must be as wide as the Mediterranean or the Atlantic-and why not?
260_123286_000023_000000 My uncle took soundings several times.
260_123286_000024_000000 But when the pick was shipped again, Hans pointed out on its surface deep prints as if it had been violently compressed between two hard bodies.
260_123286_000025_000000 I looked at the hunter.
260_123286_000027_000001 I had rather not disturb him while he is quiet.
260_123286_000027_000002 I return to the Icelander.
260_123286_000028_000000 "Teeth!" I cried, considering the iron bar with more attention.
260_123286_000029_000000 Yes, indeed, those are the marks of teeth imprinted upon the metal! The jaws which they arm must be possessed of amazing strength.
260_123286_000029_000002 I could not take my eyes off this indented iron bar.
260_123286_000031_000001 The world then belonged to reptiles.
260_123286_000031_000003 They possessed a perfect organisation, gigantic proportions, prodigious strength.
260_123286_000032_000001 No human eye has ever beheld them living.
260_123286_000032_000002 They burdened this earth a thousand ages before man appeared, but their fossil remains, found in the argillaceous limestone called by the English the lias, have enabled their colossal structure to be perfectly built up again and anatomically ascertained.
260_123286_000033_000000 I saw at the Hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length.
260_123286_000033_000002 No; surely it cannot be!
260_123286_000033_000003 Yet the deep marks of conical teeth upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile.
260_123286_000034_000002 I suppose Professor Liedenbrock was of my opinion too, and even shared my fears, for after having examined the pick, his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side.
260_123286_000034_000003 What a very bad notion that was of his, I thought to myself, to take soundings just here!
260_123286_000035_000000 I look at our guns and see that they are all right.
260_123286_000035_000001 My uncle notices it, and looks on approvingly.
260_123286_000036_000001 The danger is approaching.
260_123286_000036_000002 We must be on the look out.
260_123286_000037_000002 Hans was at the helm.
260_123286_000037_000003 During his watch I slept.
260_123286_000038_000000 Two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me.
260_123286_000038_000001 The raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again, at a distance of twenty fathoms.
260_123286_000039_000001 "Have we struck land?"
260_123286_000040_000000 Hans pointed with his finger at a dark mass six hundred yards away, rising and falling alternately with heavy plunges.
260_123286_000040_000001 I looked and cried:
260_123286_000042_000000 "Yes," replied my uncle, "and there is a sea lizard of vast size."
260_123286_000043_000001 Look at its vast jaws and its rows of teeth!
260_123286_000043_000002 It is diving down!"
260_123286_000044_000001 "I can see its great fins.
260_123286_000045_000001 We stood amazed, thunderstruck, at the presence of such a herd of marine monsters.
260_123286_000045_000002 They were of supernatural dimensions; the smallest of them would have crunched our raft, crew and all, at one snap of its huge jaws.
260_123286_000047_000000 Flight was out of the question now.
260_123286_000047_000001 The reptiles rose; they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains.
260_123286_000047_000003 I took up my rifle.
260_123286_000048_000000 We stood dumb with fear.
260_123286_000048_000002 The remainder of the sea monsters have disappeared.
260_123286_000048_000003 I prepare to fire.
260_123286_000049_000000 At three hundred yards from us the battle was fought.
260_123286_000049_000002 But it now seems to me as if the other animals were taking part in the fray-the porpoise, the whale, the lizard, the tortoise.
260_123286_000049_000005 He shakes his head negatively.
260_123286_000051_000000 "What two?
260_123286_000053_000000 "Surely you must be mistaken," I cried.
260_123286_000054_000000 "No: the first of those monsters has a porpoise's snout, a lizard's head, a crocodile's teeth; and hence our mistake.
260_123286_000055_000000 "And the other?"
260_123286_000057_000000 Hans had spoken truly.
260_123286_000057_000001 Two monsters only were creating all this commotion; and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world.
260_123286_000057_000002 I can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a red hot coal, and as large as a man's head.
260_123286_000058_000000 The plesiosaurus, a serpent with a cylindrical body and a short tail, has four flappers or paddles to act like oars.
260_123286_000058_000001 Its body is entirely covered with a thick armour of scales, and its neck, as flexible as a swan's, rises thirty feet above the waves.
260_123286_000059_000002 The two beasts are fast locked together; I cannot distinguish the one from the other.
260_123286_000060_000001 The struggle continues with unabated ferocity.
260_123286_000060_000002 The combatants alternately approach and recede from our raft.
260_123286_000060_000003 We remain motionless, ready to fire.
260_123286_000060_000004 Suddenly the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappear below, leaving a whirlpool eddying in the water.
260_123286_000060_000005 Several minutes pass by while the fight goes on under water.
260_123286_000061_000000 All at once an enormous head is darted up, the head of the plesiosaurus.
260_123286_000061_000002 I no longer see his scaly armour.
260_123286_000061_000003 Only his long neck shoots up, drops again, coils and uncoils, droops, lashes the waters like a gigantic whip, and writhes like a worm that you tread on.
260_123286_000061_000004 The water is splashed for a long way around.
260_123286_000061_000005 The spray almost blinds us.
260_123286_000061_000006 But soon the reptile's agony draws to an end; its movements become fainter, its contortions cease to be so violent, and the long serpentine form lies a lifeless log on the labouring deep.
260_123288_000001_000000 CHAPTER thirty five.
260_123288_000002_000000 AN ELECTRIC STORM
260_123288_000003_000001 The wind has risen, and has rapidly carried us away from Axel Island.
260_123288_000003_000002 The roarings become lost in the distance.
260_123288_000004_000001 The atmosphere is charged with vapours, pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters.
260_123288_000004_000002 The clouds are sinking lower, and assume an olive hue.
260_123288_000005_000000 I feel peculiar sensations, like many creatures on earth at the approach of violent atmospheric changes.
260_123288_000006_000000 In the distance the clouds resemble great bales of cotton, piled up in picturesque disorder.
260_123288_000006_000002 Such is their ponderous weight that they cannot rise from the horizon; but, obeying an impulse from higher currents, their dense consistency slowly yields.
260_123288_000006_000004 From time to time a fleecy tuft of mist, with yet some gleaming light left upon it, drops down upon the dense floor of grey, and loses itself in the opaque and impenetrable mass.
260_123288_000007_000000 The atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity. My whole body is saturated; my hair bristles just as when you stand upon an insulated stool under the action of an electrical machine.
260_123288_000007_000001 It seems to me as if my companions, the moment they touched me, would receive a severe shock like that from an electric eel.
260_123288_000008_000000 At ten in the morning the symptoms of storm become aggravated.
260_123288_000008_000001 The wind never lulls but to acquire increased strength; the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms.
260_123288_000009_000000 I am loth to believe these atmospheric menaces, and yet I cannot help muttering:
260_123288_000011_000000 The Professor made no answer.
260_123288_000011_000001 His temper is awful, to judge from the working of his features, as he sees this vast length of ocean unrolling before him to an indefinite extent.
260_123288_000011_000002 He can only spare time to shrug his shoulders viciously.
260_123288_000012_000000 "There's a heavy storm coming on," I cried, pointing towards the horizon.
260_123288_000012_000001 "Those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea."
260_123288_000013_000000 A deep silence falls on all around.
260_123288_000013_000001 The lately roaring winds are hushed into a dead calm; nature seems to breathe no more, and to be sinking into the stillness of death.
260_123288_000013_000002 On the mast already I see the light play of a lambent st Elmo's fire; the outstretched sail catches not a breath of wind, and hangs like a sheet of lead.
260_123288_000013_000003 The rudder stands motionless in a sluggish, waveless sea.
260_123288_000015_000000 "No, no! Never!" shouted my impetuous uncle.
260_123288_000015_000001 "Never!
260_123288_000015_000002 Let the wind catch us if it will!
260_123288_000016_000001 The piled up vapours condense into water; and the air, put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mists, rouses itself into a whirlwind.
260_123288_000016_000002 It rushes on from the farthest recesses of the vast cavern.
260_123288_000016_000003 The darkness deepens; scarcely can I jot down a few hurried notes.
260_123288_000016_000004 The helm makes a bound.
260_123288_000016_000005 My uncle falls full length; I creep close to him.
260_123288_000016_000006 He has laid a firm hold upon a rope, and appears to watch with grim satisfaction this awful display of elemental strife.
260_123288_000017_000000 Hans stirs not.
260_123288_000017_000001 His long hair blown by the pelting storm, and laid flat across his immovable countenance, makes him a strange figure; for the end of each lock of loose flowing hair is tipped with little luminous radiations.
260_123288_000019_000001 The sail stretches tight like a bubble ready to burst.
260_123288_000020_000000 "The sail! the sail!" I cry, motioning to lower it.
260_123288_000023_000001 But before it has reached us the rain cloud parts asunder, the sea boils, and the electric fires are brought into violent action by a mighty chemical power that descends from the higher regions.
260_123288_000023_000004 The heaving waves resemble fiery volcanic hills, each belching forth its own interior flames, and every crest is plumed with dancing fire.
260_123288_000023_000005 My eyes fail under the dazzling light, my ears are stunned with the incessant crash of thunder.
260_123288_000023_000006 I must be bound to the mast, which bows like a reed before the mighty strength of the storm.
260_123288_000024_000001 I have only been able to find a few which I seem to have jotted down almost unconsciously.
260_123288_000024_000002 But their very brevity and their obscurity reveal the intensity of the excitement which dominated me, and describe the actual position even better than my memory could do.)
260_123288_000025_000000 Sunday, twenty three.--Where are we?
260_123288_000025_000001 Driven forward with a swiftness that cannot be measured.
260_123288_000026_000000 The night was fearful; no abatement of the storm.
260_123288_000027_000000 The lightning flashes with intense brilliancy, and never seems to cease for a moment.
260_123288_000027_000002 Suppose that solid roof should crumble down upon our heads!
260_123288_000027_000003 Other flashes with incessant play cross their vivid fires, while others again roll themselves into balls of living fire which explode like bombshells, but the music of which scarcely adds to the din of the battle strife that almost deprives us of our senses of hearing and sight; the limit of intense loudness has been passed within which the human ear can distinguish one sound from another.
260_123288_000028_000000 From the under surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of lurid light; electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules; the gaseous elements of the air need to be slaked with moisture; for innumerable columns of water rush upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam.
260_123288_000029_000001 My uncle lies full length across the raft.
260_123288_000030_000000 The heat increases.
260_123288_000030_000001 I refer to the thermometer; it indicates . . . (the figure is obliterated).
260_123288_000031_000001 Is the atmospheric condition, having once reached this density, to become final?
260_123288_000032_000000 We are prostrated and worn out with fatigue.
260_123288_000032_000001 But Hans is as usual. The raft bears on still to the south-east.
260_123288_000032_000002 We have made two hundred leagues since we left Axel Island.
260_123288_000033_000000 At noon the violence of the storm redoubles.
260_123288_000033_000001 We are obliged to secure as fast as possible every article that belongs to our cargo.
260_123288_000033_000002 Each of us is lashed to some part of the raft.
260_123288_000034_000001 Our mouths open, our lips move, but not a word can be heard.
260_123288_000034_000002 We cannot even make ourselves heard by approaching our mouth close to the ear.
260_123288_000035_000000 My uncle has drawn nearer to me.
260_123288_000035_000002 They seem to be 'We are lost'; but I am not sure.
260_123288_000036_000000 At last I write down the words: "Let us lower the sail."
260_123288_000037_000000 He nods his consent.
260_123288_000038_000000 Scarcely has he lifted his head again before a ball of fire has bounded over the waves and lighted on board our raft.
260_123288_000038_000001 Mast and sail flew up in an instant together, and I saw them carried up to prodigious height, resembling in appearance a pterodactyle, one of those strong birds of the infant world.
260_123288_000039_000000 We lay there, our blood running cold with unspeakable terror.
260_123288_000039_000001 The fireball, half of it white, half azure blue, and the size of a ten inch shell, moved slowly about the raft, but revolving on its own axis with astonishing velocity, as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind.
260_123288_000039_000003 And now my turn comes; pale and trembling under the blinding splendour and the melting heat, it drops at my feet, spinning silently round upon the deck; I try to move my foot away, but cannot.
260_123288_000040_000000 A suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air, it enters the throat, it fills the lungs.
260_123288_000040_000001 We suffer stifling pains.
260_123288_000041_000001 Is it riveted to the planks?
260_123288_000041_000002 Alas! the fall upon our fated raft of this electric globe has magnetised every iron article on board.
260_123288_000041_000003 The instruments, the tools, our guns, are clashing and clanking violently in their collisions with each other; the nails of my boots cling tenaciously to a plate of iron let into the timbers, and I cannot draw my foot away from the spot.
260_123288_000042_000000 Ah! what a flood of intense and dazzling light! the globe has burst, and we are deluged with tongues of fire!
260_123288_000043_000000 Then all the light disappears.
260_123288_000043_000001 I could just see my uncle at full length on the raft, and Hans still at his helm and spitting fire under the action of the electricity which has saturated him.
260_123288_000044_000000 But where are we going to?
260_123288_000044_000001 Where?
260_123288_000045_000002 Are we still under the sea?
260_123288_000045_000003 Yes, we are borne at incalculable speed.
260_123288_000045_000004 We have been carried under England, under the channel, under France, perhaps under the whole of Europe.
260_123288_000046_000000 A fresh noise is heard!
260_123440_000001_000000 CHAPTER two.
260_123440_000001_000001 The Pool of Tears
260_123440_000002_000000 'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!
260_123440_000002_000001 Good bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?
260_123440_000002_000004 Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'
260_123440_000003_000002 And how odd the directions will look!
260_123440_000005_000000 Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'
260_123440_000007_000000 Poor Alice!
260_123440_000008_000000 'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way!
260_123440_000010_000001 How queer everything is to day!
260_123440_000010_000002 And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night?
260_123440_000010_000003 Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning?
260_123440_000010_000004 I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
260_123440_000011_000000 'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh!
260_123440_000011_000003 I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.
260_123440_000011_000004 Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is-oh dear!
260_123440_000011_000005 I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome-no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!
260_123440_000011_000006 I must have been changed for Mabel!
260_123440_000014_000000 'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn!
260_123440_000014_000001 No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here!
260_123440_000014_000002 It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I then?
260_123440_000014_000004 I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'
260_123440_000015_000000 As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking.
260_123440_000015_000001 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought.
260_123440_000018_000002 That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to day.'
260_123440_000019_000000 Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
260_123440_000020_000000 'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out of the way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?
260_123440_000021_000001 The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. 'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings.
260_123440_000022_000000 'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.
260_123440_000022_000001 'Would YOU like cats if you were me?'
260_123440_000023_000000 'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry about it.
260_123440_000023_000001 And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.
260_123440_000023_000003 'We won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not.'
260_123440_000024_000000 'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail.
260_123440_000024_000001 'As if I would talk on such a subject!
260_123440_000024_000002 Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things!
260_123440_000024_000003 Don't let me hear the name again!'
260_123440_000025_000002 A little bright eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair!
260_123440_000026_000000 So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear!

2830_3979_000005_000000 By Martin Luther
2830_3979_000006_000000 Translated by Theodore Graebner
2830_3979_000007_000000 PREFACE
2830_3979_000008_000000 The preparation of this edition of Luther's Commentary on galatians was first suggested to me by mr p j Zondervan, of the firm of publishers, in March, nineteen thirty seven.
2830_3979_000008_000001 The consultation had the twofold merit of definiteness and brevity.
2830_3979_000009_000000 "Luther is still the greatest name in Protestantism.
2830_3979_000009_000001 We want you to help us publish some leading work of Luther's for the general American market.
2830_3979_000009_000002 Will you do it?"
2830_3979_000010_000000 "I will, on one condition."
2830_3979_000011_000000 "And what is that?"
2830_3979_000012_000000 "The condition is that I will be permitted to make Luther talk American, 'streamline' him, so to speak-because you will never get people, whether in or outside the Lutheran Church, actually to read Luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to Americans."
2830_3979_000014_000000 The demonstration seemed to prove convincing for it was agreed that one may as well offer Luther in the original German or Latin as expect the American church member to read any translations that would adhere to Luther's German or Latin constructions and employ the Mid Victorian type of English characteristic of the translations now on the market.
2830_3979_000015_000000 "And what book would be your choice?"
2830_3979_000016_000001 Let us begin with that: his Commentary on galatians..."
2830_3979_000017_000001 Luther's commentary fills seven hundred and thirty three octavo pages in the Weidman Edition of his works.
2830_3979_000017_000002 It was written in Latin.
2830_3979_000017_000003 We were resolved not to present this entire mass of exegesis.
2830_3979_000017_000004 It would have run to more than fifteen hundred pages, ordinary octavo (like this), since it is impossible to use the compressed structure of sentences which is characteristic of Latin, and particularly of Luther's Latin.
2830_3979_000017_000005 The work had to be condensed.
2830_3979_000017_000006 German and English translations are available, but the most acceptable English version, besides laboring under the handicaps of an archaic style, had to be condensed into half its volume in order to accomplish the "streamlining" of the book.
2830_3979_000018_000000 The Reformer had lectured on this Epistle of saint Paul's in fifteen nineteen and again in fifteen twenty three.
2830_3979_000018_000001 It was his favorite among all the Biblical books.
2830_3979_000018_000002 In his table talks the saying is recorded: "The Epistle to the galatians is my epistle.
2830_3979_000018_000003 To it I am as it were in wedlock.
2830_3979_000018_000004 It is my Katherine." Much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his Latin works, he remarked to his home circle: "If I had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine.
2830_3979_000018_000005 My galatians, for instance."
2830_3979_000018_000006 The lectures which are preserved in the works herewith submitted to the American public were delivered in fifteen thirty one.
2830_3979_000018_000008 Roerer took down Luther's lectures and this manuscript has been preserved to the present day, in a copy which contains also additions by Veit Dietrich and by Cruciger, friends of Roerer's, who with him attended Luther's lectures.
2830_3979_000018_000009 In other words, these three men took down the lectures which Luther addressed to his students in the course of galatians, and Roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer.
2830_3979_000019_000001 It presents like no other of Luther's writings the central thought of Christianity, the justification of the sinner for the sake of Christ's merits alone.
2830_3979_000019_000003 But the essence of Luther's lectures is there.
2830_3979_000020_000000 At the end of his lectures in fifteen thirty one, Luther uttered a brief prayer and then dictated two Scriptural texts, which we shall inscribe at the end of these introductory remarks:
2830_3979_000021_000000 "The Lord who has given us power to teach and to hear, let Him also give us the power to serve and to do."
2830_3979_000023_000000 Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace, Good will to men.
2830_3979_000025_000000 The Word of our God shall stand forever.
2830_3979_000026_000000 THEODORE GRAEBNER
2830_3980_000011_000000 VERSE one.
2830_3980_000011_000001 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead).
2830_3980_000012_000000 saint Paul wrote this epistle because, after his departure from the Galatian churches, Jewish Christian fanatics moved in, who perverted Paul's Gospel of man's free justification by faith in Christ Jesus.
2830_3980_000014_000000 As a result we have this paradoxical situation: The Gospel supplies the world with the salvation of Jesus Christ, peace of conscience, and every blessing.
2830_3980_000014_000001 Just for that the world abhors the Gospel.
2830_3980_000015_000000 These Jewish Christian fanatics who pushed themselves into the Galatian churches after Paul's departure, boasted that they were the descendants of Abraham, true ministers of Christ, having been trained by the apostles themselves, that they were able to perform miracles.
2830_3980_000016_000001 They said to the galatians: "You have no right to think highly of Paul.
2830_3980_000016_000002 He was the last to turn to Christ.
2830_3980_000016_000004 We heard Him preach.
2830_3980_000016_000005 Paul came later and is beneath us.
2830_3980_000016_000007 Paul stands alone.
2830_3980_000016_000008 He has not seen Christ, nor has he had much contact with the other apostles. Indeed, he persecuted the Church of Christ for a long time."
2830_3980_000017_000000 When men claiming such credentials come along, they deceive not only the naive, but also those who seemingly are well established in the faith. This same argument is used by the papacy.
2830_3980_000017_000001 "Do you suppose that God for the sake of a few Lutheran heretics would disown His entire Church?
2830_3980_000017_000002 Or do you suppose that God would have left His Church floundering in error all these centuries?" The galatians were taken in by such arguments with the result that Paul's authority and doctrine were drawn in question.
2830_3980_000018_000000 Against these boasting, false apostles, Paul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry.
2830_3980_000018_000001 Humble man that he was, he will not now take a back seat.
2830_3980_000018_000002 He reminds them of the time when he opposed peter to his face and reproved the chief of the apostles.
2830_3980_000019_000000 Paul devotes the first two chapters to a defense of his office and his Gospel, affirming that he received it, not from men, but from the Lord Jesus Christ by special revelation, and that if he or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel than the one he had preached, he shall be accursed.
2830_3980_000020_000000 The Certainty of Our Calling
2830_3980_000021_000000 Every minister should make much of his calling and impress upon others the fact that he has been delegated by God to preach the Gospel.
2830_3980_000021_000001 As the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person, so the minister of Christ should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men.
2830_3980_000022_000000 Paul takes pride in his ministry, not to his own praise but to the praise of God.
2830_3980_000022_000002 Paul exalts his ministry out of the desire to make known the name, the grace, and the mercy of God.
2830_3980_000023_000000 VERSE one.
2830_3980_000023_000001 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, etc)
2830_3980_000024_000000 Paul loses no time in defending himself against the charge that he had thrust himself into the ministry.
2830_3980_000024_000001 He says to the galatians: "My call may seem inferior to you.
2830_3980_000024_000003 My call is the highest possible, for it is by Jesus Christ, and God the Father."
2830_3980_000026_000005 The most they could claim is that they were sent by others.
2830_3980_000026_000008 In fact I am an apostle."
2830_3980_000070_000001 If he says, "Thou shalt be damned," you tell him: "No, for I fly to Christ who gave Himself for my sins.
2830_3980_000091_000002 I am angry with you." But his purpose was to call them back to the Gospel.
2830_3980_000091_000005 It indicates his sorrow and his displeasure.
2830_3980_000096_000001 It must be watched.
2830_3980_000100_000001 There may be something to that.
2830_3980_000101_000000 VERSE six.
2830_3980_000101_000001 From him that called you into the grace of Christ.
2830_3980_000105_000000 VERSE six.
2830_3980_000105_000001 Unto another gospel.
2830_3980_000106_000004 He puts on white to make himself look like an angel of light.
2830_3980_000108_000000 Today the Anabaptists and others, finding it difficult to condemn us, accuse us Lutherans of timidity in professing the whole truth.
2830_3980_000108_000003 The devil knows better than to appear ugly and black.
2830_3980_000109_000002 Unable to prevail by force, he engages wicked and ungodly teachers who at first make common cause with us, then claim that they are particularly called to teach the hidden mysteries of the Scriptures to superimpose upon the first principles of Christian doctrine that we teach.
2830_3980_000109_000003 This sort of thing brings the Gospel into trouble.
2961_961_000002_000000 Socrates begins the Timaeus with a summary of the Republic.
2961_961_000002_000001 He lightly touches upon a few points,--the division of labour and distribution of the citizens into classes, the double nature and training of the guardians, the community of property and of women and children.
2961_961_000003_000001 But he is unable to invent such a narrative himself; and he is afraid that the poets are equally incapable; for, although he pretends to have nothing to say against them, he remarks that they are a tribe of imitators, who can only describe what they have seen.
2961_961_000004_000002 Critias when he told this tale of the olden time, was ninety years old, I being not more than ten.
2961_961_000004_000003 The occasion of the rehearsal was the day of the Apaturia called the Registration of Youth, at which our parents gave prizes for recitation.
2961_961_000004_000006 The old man brightened up at hearing this, and said: Had Solon only had the leisure which was required to complete the famous legend which he brought with him from Egypt he would have been as distinguished as Homer and Hesiod.
2961_961_000004_000007 'And what was the subject of the poem?' said the person who made the remark.
2961_961_000004_000008 The subject was a very noble one; he described the most famous action in which the Athenian people were ever engaged.
2961_961_000004_000012 Perceiving this, and with the view of eliciting information from them, he told them the tales of Phoroneus and Niobe, and also of Deucalion and Pyrrha, and he endeavoured to count the generations which had since passed.
2961_961_000004_000014 'In mind,' replied the priest, 'I mean to say that you are children; there is no opinion or tradition of knowledge among you which is white with age; and I will tell you why.
2961_961_000004_000017 For there occurs at long intervals a derangement of the heavenly bodies, and then the earth is destroyed by fire.
2961_961_000004_000019 Now the Nile is our saviour from fire, and as there is little rain in Egypt, we are not harmed by water; whereas in other countries, when a deluge comes, the inhabitants are swept by the rivers into the sea.
2961_961_000004_000021 But in Egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered for ever in our temples.
2961_961_000004_000024 The memory of them was lost, because there was no written voice among you.
2961_961_000004_000027 Nine thousand years have elapsed since she founded yours, and eight thousand since she founded ours, as our annals record.
2961_961_000004_000029 I will briefly describe them to you, and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers.
2961_961_000004_000032 The spot of earth which the goddess chose had the best of climates, and produced the wisest men; in no other was she herself, the philosopher and warrior goddess, so likely to have votaries.
2961_961_000004_000033 And there you dwelt as became the children of the gods, excelling all men in virtue, and many famous actions are recorded of you.
2961_961_000004_000034 The most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of Atlantis.
2961_961_000004_000035 This great island lay over against the Pillars of Heracles, in extent greater than Libya and Asia put together, and was the passage to other islands and to a great ocean of which the Mediterranean sea was only the harbour; and within the Pillars the empire of Atlantis reached in Europe to Tyrrhenia and in Libya to Egypt.
2961_961_000004_000036 This mighty power was arrayed against Egypt and Hellas and all the countries bordering on the Mediterranean.
2961_961_000004_000037 Then your city did bravely, and won renown over the whole earth.
2961_961_000004_000039 A little while afterwards there were great earthquakes and floods, and your warrior race all sank into the earth; and the great island of Atlantis also disappeared in the sea.
2961_961_000005_000001 But I would not speak at the time, because I wanted to refresh my memory. I had heard the old man when I was a child, and though I could not remember the whole of our yesterday's discourse, I was able to recall every word of this, which is branded into my mind; and I am prepared, Socrates, to rehearse to you the entire narrative.
2961_961_000005_000004 'I see,' replied Socrates, 'that I shall be well entertained; and do you, Timaeus, offer up a prayer and begin.'
2961_961_000007_000001 Is the world created or uncreated?--that is the first question.
2961_961_000007_000004 What is spoken of the unchanging or intelligible must be certain and true; but what is spoken of the created image can only be probable; being is to becoming what truth is to belief.
2961_961_000008_000000 SOCRATES: Excellent, Timaeus, I like your manner of approaching the subject-proceed.
2961_961_000009_000000 TIMAEUS: Why did the Creator make the world?...He was good, and therefore not jealous, and being free from jealousy he desired that all things should be like himself.
2961_961_000009_000002 Now he who is the best could only create the fairest; and reflecting that of visible things the intelligent is superior to the unintelligent, he put intelligence in soul and soul in body, and framed the universe to be the best and fairest work in the order of nature, and the world became a living soul through the providence of God.
2961_961_000010_000000 In the likeness of what animal was the world made?--that is the third question...The form of the perfect animal was a whole, and contained all intelligible beings, and the visible animal, made after the pattern of this, included all visible creatures.
2961_961_000011_000000 Are there many worlds or one only?--that is the fourth question...One only.
2961_961_000011_000001 For if in the original there had been more than one they would have been the parts of a third, which would have been the true pattern of the world; and therefore there is, and will ever be, but one created world.
2961_961_000011_000002 Now that which is created is of necessity corporeal and visible and tangible,--visible and therefore made of fire,--tangible and therefore solid and made of earth.
2961_961_000011_000003 But two terms must be united by a third, which is a mean between them; and had the earth been a surface only, one mean would have sufficed, but two means are required to unite solid bodies.
2961_961_000011_000004 And as the world was composed of solids, between the elements of fire and earth God placed two other elements of air and water, and arranged them in a continuous proportion-
2961_961_000013_000000 and so put together a visible and palpable heaven, having harmony and friendship in the union of the four elements; and being at unity with itself it was indissoluble except by the hand of the framer.
2961_961_000013_000003 All that he did was done rationally in and by himself, and he moved in a circle turning within himself, which is the most intellectual of motions; but the other six motions were wanting to him; wherefore the universe had no feet or legs.
2961_961_000014_000000 And so the thought of God made a God in the image of a perfect body, having intercourse with himself and needing no other, but in every part harmonious and self-contained and truly blessed.
2961_961_000014_000001 The soul was first made by him-the elder to rule the younger; not in the order in which our wayward fancy has led us to describe them, but the soul first and afterwards the body.
2961_961_000014_000002 God took of the unchangeable and indivisible and also of the divisible and corporeal, and out of the two he made a third nature, essence, which was in a mean between them, and partook of the same and the other, the intractable nature of the other being compressed into the same.
2961_961_000014_000003 Having made a compound of all the three, he proceeded to divide the entire mass into portions related to one another in the ratios of one, two, three, four, nine, eight, twenty seven, and proceeded to fill up the double and triple intervals thus-
2961_961_000016_000003 The entire compound was divided by him lengthways into two parts, which he united at the centre like the letter X, and bent into an inner and outer circle or sphere, cutting one another again at a point over against the point at which they cross.
2961_961_000016_000004 The outer circle or sphere was named the sphere of the same-the inner, the sphere of the other or diverse; and the one revolved horizontally to the right, the other diagonally to the left.
2961_961_000017_000001 The body of heaven is visible, but the soul is invisible, and partakes of reason and harmony, and is the best of creations, being the work of the best.
2961_961_000018_000000 When the Father who begat the world saw the image which he had made of the Eternal Gods moving and living, he rejoiced; and in his joy resolved, since the archetype was eternal, to make the creature eternal as far as this was possible.
2961_961_000018_000001 Wherefore he made an image of eternity which is time, having an uniform motion according to number, parted into months and days and years, and also having greater divisions of past, present, and future.
2961_961_000019_000000 Thus was time made in the image of the eternal nature; and it was created together with the heavens, in order that if they were dissolved, it might perish with them.
2961_961_000019_000002 He put the moon in the orbit which was nearest to the earth, the sun in that next, the morning star and Mercury in the orbits which move opposite to the sun but with equal swiftness-this being the reason why they overtake and are overtaken by one another.
2961_961_000019_000003 All these bodies became living creatures, and learnt their appointed tasks, and began to move, the nearer more swiftly, the remoter more slowly, according to the diagonal movement of the other.
2961_961_000019_000004 And since this was controlled by the movement of the same, the seven planets in their courses appeared to describe spirals; and that appeared fastest which was slowest, and that which overtook others appeared to be overtaken by them.
2961_961_000019_000005 And God lighted a fire in the second orbit from the earth which is called the sun, to give light over the whole heaven, and to teach intelligent beings that knowledge of number which is derived from the revolution of the same.
2961_961_000019_000006 Thus arose day and night, which are the periods of the most intelligent nature; a month is created by the revolution of the moon, a year by that of the sun
2961_961_000019_000007 Other periods of wonderful length and complexity are not observed by men in general; there is moreover a cycle or perfect year at the completion of which they all meet and coincide...To this end the stars came into being, that the created heaven might imitate the eternal nature.
2961_961_000020_000000 Thus far the universal animal was made in the divine image, but the other animals were not as yet included in him.
2961_961_000020_000001 And God created them according to the patterns or species of them which existed in the divine original.
2961_961_000020_000002 There are four of them: one of gods, another of birds, a third of fishes, and a fourth of animals.
2961_961_000020_000003 The gods were made in the form of a circle, which is the most perfect figure and the figure of the universe. They were created chiefly of fire, that they might be bright, and were made to know and follow the best, and to be scattered over the heavens, of which they were to be the glory.
2961_961_000020_000004 Two kinds of motion were assigned to them-first, the revolution in the same and around the same, in peaceful unchanging thought of the same; and to this was added a forward motion which was under the control of the same.
2961_961_000020_000006 The earth, which is our nurse, clinging around the pole extended through the universe, he made to be the guardian and artificer of night and day, first and eldest of gods that are in the interior of heaven.
2961_961_000020_000007 Vain would be the labour of telling all the figures of them, moving as in dance, and their juxta positions and approximations, and when and where and behind what other stars they appear to disappear-to tell of all this without looking at a plan of them would be labour in vain.
2961_961_000021_000001 Although they give no proof, we must believe them as is customary.
2961_961_000022_000000 When all of them, both those who show themselves in the sky, and those who retire from view, had come into being, the Creator addressed them thus:--'Gods, sons of gods, my works, if I will, are indissoluble.
2961_961_000022_000001 That which is bound may be dissolved, but only an evil being would dissolve that which is harmonious and happy.
2961_961_000022_000002 And although you are not immortal you shall not die, for I will hold you together.
2961_961_000022_000003 Hear me, then:--Three tribes of mortal beings have still to be created, but if created by me they would be like gods.
2961_961_000022_000004 Do ye therefore make them; I will implant in them the seed of immortality, and you shall weave together the mortal and immortal, and provide food for them, and receive them again in death.' Thus he spake, and poured the remains of the elements into the cup in which he had mingled the soul of the universe.
2961_961_000022_000005 They were no longer pure as before, but diluted; and the mixture he distributed into souls equal in number to the stars, and assigned each to a star-then having mounted them, as in a chariot, he showed them the nature of the universe, and told them of their future birth and human lot.
2961_961_000022_000007 The souls were to be implanted in bodies, which were in a perpetual flux, whence, he said, would arise, first, sensation; secondly, love, which is a mixture of pleasure and pain; thirdly, fear and anger, and the opposite affections: and if they conquered these, they would live righteously, but if they were conquered by them, unrighteously.
2961_961_000023_000001 And his children, receiving from him the immortal principle, borrowed from the world portions of earth, air, fire, water, hereafter to be returned, which they fastened together, not with the adamantine bonds which bound themselves, but by little invisible pegs, making each separate body out of all the elements, subject to influx and efflux, and containing the courses of the soul.
2961_961_000023_000002 These swelling and surging as in a river moved irregularly and irrationally in all the six possible ways, forwards, backwards, right, left, up and down.
2961_961_000023_000003 But violent as were the internal and alimentary fluids, the tide became still more violent when the body came into contact with flaming fire, or the solid earth, or gliding waters, or the stormy wind; the motions produced by these impulses pass through the body to the soul and have the name of sensations.
2961_961_000023_000006 And something similar happens when the disordered motions of the soul come into contact with any external thing; they say the same or the other in a manner which is the very opposite of the truth, and they are false and foolish, and have no guiding principle in them.
2961_961_000023_000007 And when external impressions enter in, they are really conquered, though they seem to conquer.
2961_961_000024_000000 By reason of these affections the soul is at first without intelligence, but as time goes on the stream of nutriment abates, and the courses of the soul regain their proper motion, and apprehend the same and the other rightly, and become rational.
2961_961_000024_000001 The soul of him who has education is whole and perfect and escapes the worst disease, but, if a man's education be neglected, he walks lamely through life and returns good for nothing to the world below.
2961_961_000024_000002 This, however, is an after stage-at present, we are only concerned with the creation of the body and soul.
2961_961_000025_000000 The two divine courses were encased by the gods in a sphere which is called the head, and is the god and lord of us.
2961_961_000025_000003 They first contrived the eyes, into which they conveyed a light akin to the light of day, making it flow through the pupils.
2961_961_000025_000005 But when the visual ray goes forth into the darkness, then unlike falls upon unlike-the eye no longer sees, and we go to sleep.
2961_961_000025_000006 The fire or light, when kept in by the eyelids, equalizes the inward motions, and there is rest accompanied by few dreams; only when the greater motions remain they engender in us corresponding visions of the night.
2961_961_000025_000008 The fires from within and from without meet about the smooth and bright surface of the mirror; and because they meet in a manner contrary to the usual mode, the right and left sides of the object are transposed.
2961_961_000026_000002 Of the second or concurrent causes of sight I have already spoken, and I will now speak of the higher purpose of God in giving us eyes.
2961_961_000026_000003 Sight is the source of the greatest benefits to us; for if our eyes had never seen the sun, stars, and heavens, the words which we have spoken would not have been uttered.
2961_961_000026_000004 The sight of them and their revolutions has given us the knowledge of number and time, the power of enquiry, and philosophy, which is the great blessing of human life; not to speak of the lesser benefits which even the vulgar can appreciate.
2961_961_000026_000005 God gave us the faculty of sight that we might behold the order of the heavens and create a corresponding order in our own erring minds.
3005_163389_000001_000000 CHAPTER twenty two.
3005_163389_000002_000000 THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn's house, a whooping and raging like Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush, and it was awful to see.
3005_163389_000003_000000 They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they could jam together, and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise.
3005_163389_000003_000001 It was a little twenty foot yard.
3005_163389_000003_000002 Some sung out "Tear down the fence!
3005_163389_000003_000003 tear down the fence!" Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave.
3005_163389_000004_000000 Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch, with a double barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly ca'm and deliberate, not saying a word.
3005_163389_000004_000001 The racket stopped, and the wave sucked back.
3005_163389_000005_000000 Sherburn never said a word  just stood there, looking down.
3005_163389_000005_000001 The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable.
3005_163389_000005_000002 Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out gaze him, but they couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky.
3005_163389_000006_000000 Then he says, slow and scornful:
3005_163389_000007_000001 It's amusing.
3005_163389_000008_000000 "Do I know you?
3005_163389_000008_000001 I know you clear through.
3005_163389_000008_000005 Why don't your juries hang murderers?
3005_163389_000009_000001 Your mistake is, that you didn't bring a man with you; that's one mistake, and the other is that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your masks.
3005_163389_000010_000000 "You didn't want to come.
3005_163389_000010_000001 The average man don't like trouble and danger.
3005_163389_000010_000004 The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that's what an army is  a mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in them, but with courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from their officers.
3005_163389_000011_000000 The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking tolerable cheap.
3005_163389_000011_000001 I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn't want to.
3005_163389_000012_000000 I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by, and then dived in under the tent.
3005_163389_000012_000002 You can't be too careful.
3005_163389_000013_000000 It was a real bully circus.
3005_163389_000014_000001 And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild.
3005_163389_000015_000000 Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people.
3005_163389_000015_000008 It warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a going like a house afire too.
3005_163389_000015_000010 He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits.
3005_163389_000015_000011 And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum  and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressing room, and everybody just a howling with pleasure and astonishment.
3005_163389_000016_000001 Why, it was one of his own men!
3005_163389_000016_000002 He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on to nobody.
3005_163389_000016_000004 I don't know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I never struck them yet.
3005_163389_000017_000001 And they laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before the show was over, but one boy which was asleep.
3005_163389_000017_000002 So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy  and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he reckoned.
3005_163389_000017_000003 He said he could size their style.
3005_163389_000017_000004 So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.
3005_163389_000017_000005 The bills said:
3005_163390_000001_000000 CHAPTER twenty three.
3005_163390_000002_000000 WELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was jam full of men in no time.
3005_163390_000002_000002 And  but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful funny.
3005_163390_000002_000003 The people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed and haw hawed till he come back and done it over again, and after that they made him do it another time.
3005_163390_000004_000000 Twenty people sings out:
3005_163390_000005_000000 "What, is it over?
3005_163390_000006_000000 The duke says yes.
3005_163390_000006_000001 Then there was a fine time.
3005_163390_000006_000003 But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts:
3005_163390_000007_000000 "Hold on!
3005_163390_000007_000001 Just a word, gentlemen." They stopped to listen.
3005_163390_000007_000002 "We are sold  mighty badly sold.
3005_163390_000007_000005 Then we'll all be in the same boat.
3005_163390_000007_000006 Ain't that sensible?" ("You bet it is!  the jedge is right!" everybody sings out.) "All right, then  not a word about any sell.
3005_163390_000007_000007 Go along home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy."
3005_163390_000008_000000 Next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was.
3005_163390_000008_000001 House was jammed again that night, and we sold this crowd the same way.
3005_163390_000009_000001 I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat  and I see it warn't no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight.
3005_163390_000009_000004 Well, when the place couldn't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after him; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:
3005_163390_000010_000000 "Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you!"
3005_163390_000011_000000 I done it, and he done the same.
3005_163390_000011_000001 We struck the raft at the same time, and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and still, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a word.
3005_163390_000011_000002 I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam, and says:
3005_163390_000012_000000 "Well, how'd the old thing pan out this time, duke?" He hadn't been up town at all.
3005_163390_000013_000000 We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village. Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they'd served them people.
3005_163390_000013_000001 The duke says:
3005_163390_000014_000000 "Greenhorns, flatheads!
3005_163390_000015_000000 Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty five dollars in that three nights.
3005_163390_000016_000000 "Don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?"
3005_163390_000019_000000 "Well, it don't, because it's in the breed.
3005_163390_000021_000000 "Well, that's what I'm a saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as fur as I can make out."
3005_163390_000023_000000 "You read about them once  you'll see.
3005_163390_000023_000002 And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and james Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain.
3005_163390_000023_000003 My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom.
3005_163390_000023_000005 He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning.
3005_163390_000023_000006 And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs.
3005_163390_000023_000007 'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he says.
3005_163390_000023_000008 They fetch her up. Next morning, 'Chop off her head!' And they chop it off.
3005_163390_000023_000009 'Fetch up Jane Shore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, 'Chop off her head'  and they chop it off.
3005_163390_000023_000010 'Ring up Fair Rosamun.' Fair Rosamun answers the bell.
3005_163390_000023_000013 Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country.
3005_163390_000023_000014 How does he go at it  give notice?  give the country a show?
3005_163390_000023_000018 Well, what did he do?
3005_163390_000023_000019 Ask him to show up?
3005_163390_000023_000020 No  drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat.
3005_163390_000023_000021 S'pose people left money laying around where he was  what did he do?
3005_163390_000023_000023 He always done the other thing.
3005_163390_000023_000024 S'pose he opened his mouth  what then?
3005_163390_000023_000025 If he didn't shut it up powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time.
3005_163390_000023_000028 All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances.
3005_163390_000023_000030 It's the way they're raised."
3005_163390_000025_000000 "Well, they all do, Jim.
3005_163390_000027_000000 "Yes, a duke's different.
3005_163390_000027_000001 But not very different.
3005_163390_000027_000002 This one's a middling hard lot for a duke.
3005_163390_000027_000003 When he's drunk there ain't no near sighted man could tell him from a king."
3005_163390_000029_000000 "It's the way I feel, too, Jim.
3005_163390_000029_000001 But we've got them on our hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances.
3005_163390_000029_000002 Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that's out of kings."
3005_163390_000030_000000 What was the use to tell Jim these warn't real kings and dukes?
3005_163390_000031_000000 I went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn.
3005_163390_000031_000001 He often done that.
3005_163390_000031_000002 When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself.
3005_163390_000031_000003 I didn't take notice nor let on.
3005_163390_000031_000004 I knowed what it was about.
3005_163390_000037_000001 I was a bilin'!
3005_163390_000037_000002 I says:
3005_163391_000001_000000 NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.
3005_163391_000001_000001 Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.
3005_163391_000002_000003 Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:
3005_163391_000004_000001 Jim was satisfied.
3005_163391_000004_000002 He said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all over every time there was a sound.
3005_163391_000004_000003 The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he wouldn't wait for him to howl.
3005_163391_000004_000004 Why, he didn't only look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.
3005_163391_000005_000000 These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time.
3005_163391_000005_000003 I done it, of course.
3005_163391_000005_000004 The king's duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.
3005_163391_000005_000005 I never knowed how clothes could change a body before.
3005_163391_000005_000007 Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready.
3005_163391_000006_000001 Go for the steamboat, Huckleberry; we'll come down to the village on her."
3005_163391_000008_000000 "Run her nose in shore," says the king.
3005_163391_000008_000001 I done it.
3005_163391_000009_000000 "For the steamboat; going to Orleans."
3005_163391_000010_000000 "Git aboard," says the king.
3005_163391_000010_000002 Jump out and he'p the gentleman, Adolphus"  meaning me, I see.
3005_163391_000011_000000 I done so, and then we all three started on again.
3005_163391_000011_000002 The young fellow says:
3005_163391_000014_000001 peter and George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married brother; him and his wife both died last year.
3005_163391_000014_000002 Harvey and William's the only ones that's left now; and, as I was saying, they haven't got here in time."
3005_163391_000015_000000 "Did anybody send 'em word?"
3005_163391_000016_000002 He most desperately wanted to see Harvey  and William, too, for that matter  because he was one of them kind that can't bear to make a will.
3005_163391_000016_000004 And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to."
3005_163391_000018_000000 "Oh, he lives in England  Sheffield  preaches there  hasn't ever been in this country.
3005_163391_000019_000000 "Too bad, too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers, poor soul. You going to Orleans, you say?"
3005_163391_000020_000000 "Yes, but that ain't only a part of it.
3005_163391_000021_000000 "It's a pretty long journey.
3005_163391_000021_000001 But it'll be lovely; wisht I was a going. Is Mary Jane the oldest?
3005_163391_000021_000002 How old is the others?"
3005_163391_000022_000000 "Mary Jane's nineteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joanna's about fourteen  that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare lip."
3005_163391_000023_000000 "Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so."
3005_163391_000024_000000 "Well, they could be worse off.
3005_163391_000025_000000 Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow.
3005_163391_000025_000001 Blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about Peter's business  which was a tanner; and about George's  which was a carpenter; and about Harvey's  which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and so on.
3005_163391_000025_000002 Then he says:
3005_163391_000026_000000 "What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?"
3005_163391_000027_000000 "Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop there.
3005_163391_000027_000001 When they're deep they won't stop for a hail.
3005_163391_000027_000002 A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a saint Louis one."
3005_163391_000028_000000 "Was peter Wilks well off?"
3005_163391_000029_000000 "Oh, yes, pretty well off.
3005_163391_000029_000001 He had houses and land, and it's reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers."
3005_163391_000030_000000 "When did you say he died?"
3005_163391_000032_000000 "Funeral to morrow, likely?"
3005_163391_000034_000000 "Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or another.
3005_163391_000035_000000 "Yes, sir, it's the best way.
3005_163391_000036_000000 When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she got off.
3005_163391_000036_000001 The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost my ride, after all.
3005_163391_000036_000002 When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:
3005_163391_000037_000000 "Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new carpet bags.
3005_163391_000037_000002 And tell him to git himself up regardless.
3005_163391_000037_000003 Shove along, now."
3005_163391_000038_000004 Then he says:
3005_163391_000039_000000 "How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?"
3005_163391_000040_000001 So then they waited for a steamboat.
3005_163391_000041_000000 About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along, but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there was a big one, and they hailed her.
3005_163391_000041_000001 She sent out her yawl, and we went aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and said they wouldn't land us.
3005_163391_000041_000002 But the king was ca'm.
3005_163391_000041_000003 He says:
3005_163391_000046_000000 Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his back, and says:
3005_163391_000048_000000 Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a carpet bag and bust out a crying.
3005_163391_000048_000001 If they warn't the beatenest lot, them two frauds, that ever I struck.
3005_163399_000002_000000 Phelps' was one of these little one horse cotton plantations, and they all look alike.
3005_163399_000004_000000 I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for I'd noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if I left it alone.
3005_163399_000005_000000 When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went for me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still.
3005_163399_000005_000001 And such another powwow as they made!
3005_163399_000006_000001 There ain't no harm in a hound, nohow.
3005_163399_000007_000000 And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but tow linen shirts, and they hung on to their mother's gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way they always do.
3005_163399_000007_000002 She was smiling all over so she could hardly stand  and says:
3005_163399_000010_000000 She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over; and she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, "You don't look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law sakes, I don't care for that, I'm so glad to see you!
3005_163399_000010_000002 Children, it's your cousin Tom!  tell him howdy."
3005_163399_000011_000000 But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and hid behind her.
3005_163399_000011_000001 So she run on:
3005_163399_000012_000000 "Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away  or did you get your breakfast on the boat?"
3005_163399_000013_000000 I said I had got it on the boat.
3005_163399_000013_000001 So then she started for the house, leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after.
3005_163399_000013_000002 When we got there she set me down in a split bottomed chair, and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:
3005_163399_000014_000001 We been expecting you a couple of days and more.
3005_163399_000015_000000 "Yes'm  she  "
3005_163399_000016_000000 "Don't say yes'm  say Aunt Sally.
3005_163399_000016_000001 Where'd she get aground?"
3005_163399_000017_000000 I didn't rightly know what to say, because I didn't know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down.
3005_163399_000017_000001 But I go a good deal on instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up  from down towards Orleans.
3005_163399_000017_000002 That didn't help me much, though; for I didn't know the names of bars down that way.
3005_163399_000017_000003 I see I'd got to invent a bar, or forget the name of the one we got aground on  or  Now I struck an idea, and fetched it out:
3005_163399_000018_000000 "It warn't the grounding  that didn't keep us back but a little.
3005_163399_000018_000001 We blowed out a cylinder head."
3005_163399_000019_000000 "Good gracious! anybody hurt?"
3005_163399_000020_000000 "No'm. Killed a nigger."
3005_163399_000021_000000 "Well, it's lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.
3005_163399_000021_000002 And I think he died afterwards.
3005_163399_000021_000003 He was a Baptist.
3005_163399_000021_000004 Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well.
3005_163399_000021_000006 Mortification set in, and they had to amputate him.
3005_163399_000021_000007 But it didn't save him.
3005_163399_000021_000008 Yes, it was mortification  that was it.
3005_163399_000021_000009 He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection.
3005_163399_000021_000010 They say he was a sight to look at.
3005_163399_000021_000011 Your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you.
3005_163399_000021_000012 And he's gone again, not more'n an hour ago; he'll be back any minute now.
3005_163399_000021_000013 You must a met him on the road, didn't you?  oldish man, with a  "
3005_163399_000022_000000 "No, I didn't see nobody, Aunt Sally.
3005_163399_000024_000000 "Nobody."
3005_163399_000026_000000 "Not where I hid it I reckon it won't," I says.
3005_163399_000027_000000 "How'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat?"
3005_163399_000028_000000 It was kinder thin ice, but I says:
3005_163399_000030_000000 I was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good.
3005_163399_000030_000001 I had my mind on the children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little, and find out who I was.
3005_163399_000030_000002 But I couldn't get no show, mrs Phelps kept it up and run on so.
3005_163399_000032_000000 Well, I see I was up a stump  and up it good.
3005_163399_000032_000002 I see it warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead  I'd got to throw up my hand.
3005_163399_000032_000003 So I says to myself, here's another place where I got to resk the truth. I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed, and says:
3005_163399_000033_000002 Don't you let on you're here.
3005_163399_000033_000003 I'll play a joke on him. Children, don't you say a word."
3005_163399_000034_000000 I see I was in a fix now.
3005_163399_000035_000001 mrs Phelps she jumps for him, and says:
3005_163399_000036_000000 "Has he come?"
3005_163399_000037_000000 "No," says her husband.
3005_163399_000039_000000 "I can't imagine," says the old gentleman; "and I must say it makes me dreadful uneasy."
3005_163399_000040_000000 "Uneasy!" she says; "I'm ready to go distracted!
3005_163399_000042_000002 You must a missed him.
3005_163399_000042_000003 He  "
3005_163399_000043_000000 "Oh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already distressed.
3005_163399_000043_000004 Sally, it's terrible  just terrible  something's happened to the boat, sure!"
3005_163399_000044_000000 "Why, Silas!
3005_163399_000044_000001 Look yonder!  up the road!  ain't that somebody coming?"
3005_163399_000045_000000 He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give mrs Phelps the chance she wanted.
3005_163399_000045_000001 She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the window there she stood, a beaming and a smiling like a house afire, and I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside.
3005_163399_000045_000002 The old gentleman stared, and says:
3005_163399_000046_000000 "Why, who's that?"
3005_163399_000048_000000 "I hain't no idea.
3005_163399_000050_000000 By jings, I most slumped through the floor!
3005_163399_000050_000001 But there warn't no time to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary, and the rest of the tribe.
3005_163399_000051_000000 But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for it was like being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was.
3005_163399_000051_000004 If I'd a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well.
3005_163399_000052_000000 Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty uncomfortable all up the other.
3005_163399_000052_000001 Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river.
3005_163399_000052_000002 Then I says to myself, s'pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat?
3005_163399_000052_000003 And s'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?
3005_163399_000053_000001 I must go up the road and waylay him.
3005_163399_000053_000002 So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage.
3080_5032_000002_000001 My father has lost his too, and my eldest brother, but we all look like people risen from the dead.
3080_5032_000002_000002 Only my cousin Molle keeps his still; and, in earnest, I am not certain whether he would lose it or not, for it gives him a lawful occasion of being nice and cautious about himself, to which he in his own humour is so much inclined that 'twere not easy for him to forbear it.
3080_5032_000002_000004 I'll swear her friends are much to blame to let her go abroad.
3080_5032_000003_000000 But I am hugely pleased that you have seen my Lady.
3080_5032_000003_000001 I knew you could not choose but like her; but yet, let me tell you, you have seen but the worst of her.
3080_5032_000003_000003 You had strange luck to meet my brother so soon.
3080_5032_000003_000004 He went up but last Tuesday.
3080_5032_000003_000011 You have been there, I am sure.
3080_5032_000003_000016 Forgive me that this is no longer, for
3080_5032_000004_000000 I am your.
3080_5032_000008_000001 I never deserved a long letter so much as now, when you sent me a short one.
3080_5032_000008_000003 In earnest, we have had such a skirmish, and upon so foolish an occasion, as I cannot tell which is strangest.
3080_5032_000008_000007 My best qualities (if I have any that are good) served but for aggravations of my fault, and I was allowed to have wit and understanding and discretion in other things, that it might appear I had none in this.
3080_5032_000008_000008 Well, 'twas a pretty lecture, and I grew warm with it after a while; in short, we came so near an absolute falling out, that 'twas time to give over, and we said so much then that we have hardly spoken a word together since.
3080_5032_000009_000002 If anything could be wonder'd at in this age, I should very much how you came by your informations.
3080_5032_000009_000003 'tis more than I know if mr Freeman be my servant.
3080_5032_000009_000005 Do you know him?
3080_5032_000010_000002 I have no company now but my niece Peyton, and my brother will be shortly for the term, but will make no long stay in town.
3080_5032_000010_000003 I think my youngest brother comes down with him.
3080_5032_000010_000005 I have no room for more than
3080_5032_000013_000001 I can no sooner give you some little hints whereabouts they live, but you know them presently, and I meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance.
3080_5032_000013_000002 But it seems this gentleman is not so easy access, but you may acknowledge something due to me, if I incline him to look graciously upon you, and therefore there is not much harm done.
3080_5032_000013_000004 All that is to be hoped is, that since he may reduce whomsoever he pleases to his obedience, he will be very curious in his choice, and then I am secure.
3080_5032_000014_000000 It may be I dreamt it that you had met my brother, or else it was one of the reveries of my ague; if so, I hope I shall fall into no more of them.
3080_5032_000014_000003 But, besides, I can give you others.
3080_5032_000014_000007 But, I thank God, an imagination took him one morning that he was falling into a dropsy, and made him in such haste to go back to Cambridge to his doctor, that he never remembers anything he has to ask of me, but the coach to carry him away.
3080_5032_000014_000008 I lent it most willingly, and gone he is.
3080_5032_000014_000011 You will think him altered (and, if it be possible) more melancholy than he was.
3080_5032_000014_000012 If marriage agrees no better with other people than it does with him, I shall pray that all my friends may 'scape it.
3080_5032_000014_000013 Yet if I were my cousin, h Danvers, my Lady Diana should not, if I could help it, as well as I love her: I would try if ten thousand pound a year with a husband that doted on her, as I should do, could not keep her from being unhappy.
3080_5032_000014_000021 she's cruel, and how far her power may reach I know not, only I am sure, she cannot call back time that is past, and it is long since we resolved to be for ever
3080_5040_000000_000003 I told them I knew no remedy but leaving me behind next time, and could have told them that my looks were suitable to my fortune, though not to a feast.
3080_5040_000000_000005 I am got into my complaining humour that tires myself as well as everybody else, and which (as you observe) helps not at all.
3080_5040_000000_000006 Would it would leave me, and then I could believe I shall not always have occasion for it.
3080_5040_000000_000007 But that's in nobody's power, and my Lady Talmash, that says she can do whatsoever she will, cannot believe whatsoever she pleases.
3080_5040_000000_000010 You have no such ladies in Ireland?
3080_5040_000001_000001 Is it true?
3080_5040_000001_000003 The less one knows of State affairs I find it is the better.
3080_5040_000001_000004 My poor Lady Vavasour is carried to the Tower, and her great belly could not excuse her, because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against the Protector, and did not discover it.
3080_5040_000001_000006 I wonder how she behaved herself when she was married.
3080_5040_000001_000008 He came down into the country where she was upon a visit, and one morning married her.
3080_5040_000002_000001 Do not take it ill, for I would endure it if I could, rather than fail; but in earnest I do not think it were possible for me.
3080_5040_000002_000004 I know not how he may be prejudiced as to the business, but he is not deaf to reason when 'tis civilly delivered, and is as easily gained with compliance and good usage as anybody I know, but by no other way.
3080_5040_000003_000000 I make it a case of conscience to discover my faults to you as fast as I know them, that you may consider what you have to do.
3080_5040_000003_000001 My aunt told me no longer agone than yesterday that I was the most wilful woman that ever she knew, and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome.
3080_5040_000003_000002 Take heed! you see I give you fair warning.
3080_5040_000005_000000 Here are some verses of Cowley's.
3080_5040_000005_000001 Tell me how you like them.
3080_5040_000009_000000 I told you in my last that my Suffolk journey was laid aside, and that into Kent hastened.
3080_5040_000009_000001 I am beginning it to day; and have chosen to go as far as Gravesend by water, though it be very gloomy weather.
3080_5040_000009_000002 If I drown by the way, this will be my last letter; and, like a will, I bequeath all my kindness to you in it, with a charge never to bestow it all upon another mistress, lest my ghost rise again and haunt you.
3080_5040_000009_000005 Pray let me know whether your man leaves you, and how you stand inclined to him I offer you.
3080_5040_000009_000006 Indeed, I like him extremely, and he is commended to me, by people that know him very well and are able to judge, for a most excellent servant, and faithful as possible.
3080_5040_000010_000000 My next shall make amends for this short one.
3080_5040_000014_000000 Because you find fault with my other letters, this is like to be shorter than they; I did not intend it so though, I can assure you.
3080_5040_000014_000003 I do not find it, though I am told I was so extremely when I believed you loved me.
3080_5040_000014_000004 That I would not find, and you have only power to make me think it.
3080_5040_000014_000005 But I am called upon.
3080_5040_000016_000000 [Directed.] For your master.
3080_5040_000018_000004 However, 'tis not amiss that my will made you know now how to dispose of all my wealth whensoever I die.
3080_5040_000018_000007 How welcome you will be. But, alas!
3080_5040_000018_000008 I cannot talk on't at the rate that you do.
3080_5040_000019_000000 My humour is so ill at present, that I dare say no more lest you chide me again.
3080_5040_000019_000002 'tis the pleasantest thing that can be to hear us discourse.
3080_5040_000019_000005 All this is perfect nonsense in their opinion; but I should not doubt the convincing them if I could hope to be so happy as to be
3080_5040_000020_000000 Yours.
3080_5040_000022_000000 How long this letter will be I cannot tell.
3080_5040_000022_000001 You shall have all the time that is allowed me, but upon condition that you shall not examine the sense on't too strictly, for you must know I want sleep extremely.
3080_5040_000022_000002 The sun was up an hour before I went to bed to day, and this is not the first time I have done this since I came hither.
3080_5040_000022_000004 We go abroad all day and play all night, and say our prayers when we have time.
3080_5040_000022_000005 Well, in sober earnest now, I would not live thus a twelvemonth to gain all that the King has lost, unless it were to give it him again.
3080_5040_000022_000006 'tis a miracle to me how my brother endures it.
3080_5040_000022_000009 He has certainly as great a kindness for her as can be, and, to say truth, not without reason; but all the people that ever I saw, I do not like his carriage towards her.
3080_5040_000022_000010 He is perpetually wrangling and finding fault, and to a person that did not know him would appear the worst husband and the most imperious in the world.
3080_5040_000022_000011 He is so amongst his children too, though he loves them passionately.
3331_159605_000001_000000 CHAPTER fourteen.
3331_159605_000002_000000 ON the evening of Fan's visit, Polly sat down before her fire with a resolute and thoughtful aspect.
3331_159605_000002_000004 I know it 's considered proper for girls to shut their eyes and let things come to a crisis no matter how much mischief is done.
3331_159605_000002_000008 The more proposals, the more credit.
3331_159605_000002_000010 What wicked creatures we are!
3331_159605_000002_000011 some of us at least.
3331_159605_000002_000012 I wonder why such a love of conquest was put into us? Mother says a great deal of it is owing to bad education nowadays, but some girls seem born for the express purpose of making trouble and would manage to do it if they lived in a howling wilderness.
3331_159605_000005_000002 They all think a great deal of him because he is so hard to please, and almost any of them would feel immensely flattered if he liked them, whether they chose to marry him or not.
3331_159605_000006_000000 "It don't do to think of her, and I won't!" said Polly to herself, setting her lips with a grim look that was not at all becoming.
3331_159605_000006_000001 "What an easy life I should have plenty of money, quantities of friends, all sorts of pleasures, and no work, no poverty, no cold shoulders or patched boots.
3331_159605_000006_000002 I could do so much for all at home how I should enjoy that!" And Polly let her thoughts revel in the luxurious future her fancy painted.
3331_159605_000006_000005 Polly Sydney don't sound well, and mrs Arthur Sydney don't seem to fit me a bit.
3331_159605_000008_000000 "I won't think of myself, or try to mend one mistake by making another," she said with a heavy sigh.
3331_159605_000008_000002 Let me see, how can I begin?
3331_159605_000008_000004 I never had much faith in the remarkable coincidence of his always happening home to dinner just as I go to give the Roths their lesson.
3331_159605_000008_000009 Oh, me!
3331_159605_000008_000010 I wish the other trouble could be cured as easily as this."
3331_159605_000010_000001 Polly, I 'm ashamed of you!
3331_159605_000010_000002 What would your blessed mother say to hear such expressions from you?
3331_159605_000010_000006 I do think Fan would suit him excellently by and by.
3331_159605_000012_000002 Minnie happened to be poorly that week and took no lesson, so Uncle Syd was deprived of his last hope, and looked as if his allowance of sunshine had been suddenly cut off.
3331_159605_000013_000002 I don't think it was his wealth, accomplishments, or position that most attracted Polly, though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected.
3331_159605_000013_000004 This had an especial charm to Polly, for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to every one.
3331_159605_000013_000006 But with Fanny and Polly he showed the domestic traits and virtues which are more engaging to womanly women than any amount of cool intellect or worldly wisdom.
3331_159605_000015_000002 Then she took a fancy into her head that she ought to accept this piece of good fortune for the sake of the family, and forget herself.
3331_159605_000015_000005 But Polly's education had been neglected, and after a good deal of natural indecision she did what most women do in such cases, thought she would "wait and see."
3331_159605_000016_000001 This finished Polly's indecision, and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl with a spice of the old Eve in her composition.
3331_159605_000018_000000 "Who is here, Katy?"
3331_159605_000019_000000 "Only mr Sydney and Master Tom.
3331_159605_000019_000001 Won't you stop a bit, Miss Polly?"
3331_159605_000023_000000 "Take hold of Master Charley's hand, Miss Mamie, and walk pretty, like Willy and Flossy," said the maid.
3331_159605_000025_000000 "Willy likes Flossy best, so stop crying and come right along, you naughty child."
3331_159605_000026_000000 As poor little Dido was jerked away by the unsympathetic maid, and Purple gaiters essayed in vain to plead his cause, Polly said to herself, with a smile and a sigh; "How early the old story begins!"
3331_159605_000028_000000 At a street corner, a black eyed school boy was parting from a rosy faced school girl, whose music roll he was reluctantly surrendering.
3331_159605_000032_000000 "How happy they seem; oh, dear!" said Polly, and trudged on, wondering if her turn would ever come and fearing that it was impossible.
3331_159605_000036_000000 "You seem to find it so." And Polly laughed, with a sudden sparkle in her eyes.
3331_159605_000036_000001 She really could n't help it, it was so pleasant to see him again, just when she was feeling so lonely.
3331_159605_000037_000000 "Have you given up teaching the Roths?" asked Sydney, changing the subject.
3331_159605_000038_000000 "no"
3331_159605_000039_000000 "Do you go as usual?"
3331_159605_000040_000000 "Yes."
3331_159605_000043_000000 "I saw you from the Shaws' window and took the liberty of running after you by the back street," he said, laughing.
3331_159605_000044_000001 She did not mean to tell, but his frankness was so agreeable she forgot herself.
3331_159605_000046_000000 "I know it, but people sometimes get tired of old ways and like to try new ones."
3331_159605_000047_000000 Polly did n't say that quite naturally, and Sydney gave her a quick look, as he asked; "Do you get tired of old friends, too, Miss Polly?"
3331_159605_000048_000000 "Not often; but"
3331_159605_000049_000000 There was a dreadful little pause, which Polly broke by saying abruptly; "How is Fan?"
3331_159605_000050_000000 "Dashing, as ever.
3331_159605_000051_000000 "Ah, you never see her at her best.
3331_159605_000054_000000 "Oh, but I don't!
3331_159605_000059_000000 "How lovely the park looks," she said, in great confusion.
3331_159605_000060_000000 "Yes, it 's the pleasantest walk we have; don't you think so?" asked the artful young man, laying a trap, into which Polly immediately fell.
3331_159605_000061_000000 "Yes, indeed!
3331_159605_000061_000001 It 's always so refreshing to me to see a little bit of the country, as it were, especially at this season."
3331_159605_000062_000000 Oh, Polly, Polly, what a stupid speech to make, when you had just given him to understand that you were tired of the park!
3331_159605_000065_000000 He was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorseful face, and she walked on, feeling that the first and perhaps the only lover she would ever have, had read his answer and accepted it in silence.
3331_159605_000068_000000 "What have you been doing with yourself lately?" asked Fanny, composing herself, with her back toward the rapidly waning light.
3331_159605_000070_000000 "Nothing particular.
3331_159605_000070_000001 Trix treats Tom shamefully, and he bears it like a lamb.
3331_159605_000076_000000 "Minnie said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the puddles and not fuss about rubbers."
3331_159605_000082_000000 "Who got up that nice idea, I should like to know?" demanded Polly, as Fanny stopped for breath.
3331_159605_000085_000000 "Don't you think he means to?"
3331_159605_000088_000000 "no"
3331_159605_000089_000000 "Truly?"
3331_159605_000090_000000 "Truly, Fan."
3331_159605_000092_000000 "Don't you think he cared for you, dear?" asked Fanny, presently.
3331_159605_000096_000000 "Yes."
3331_159605_000099_000000 "I just gave him a hint and he took it.
3331_159605_000099_000002 He understood, and being a gentleman, made no fuss.
3331_159609_000000_000000 Fortunately every one was so busy with the necessary preparations that there was no time for romance of any sort, and the four young people worked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not bottled up in their respective hearts.
3331_159609_000001_000002 Tom wrote once a week to his mother, but the letters were short and not very satisfactory, for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear.
3331_159609_000001_000003 Fanny forwarded her bits of news to Polly.
3331_159609_000002_000001 She never said much of herself in her letters, and Fanny's first exclamation when they met again, was an anxious "Why, Polly, dear! Have you been sick and never told me?"
3331_159609_000004_000000 "You don't look a bit natural.
3331_159609_000005_000000 Polly did not look sick, though her cheeks were thinner and her color paler than formerly, but she seemed spiritless, and there was a tired look in her eyes that went to Fanny's heart.
3331_159609_000006_000001 I 'm proper glad to find you looking so well and happy.
3331_159609_000007_000001 "Tell me, truly, have you never repented of your hint to Sydney?"
3331_159609_000009_000000 "On your honor, as an honest girl?"
3331_159609_000010_000000 "On my honor, as anything you please.
3331_159609_000015_000000 There was no answer to her question, but she was satisfied and putting her arm round her friend, she said, in her most persuasive tone, "My precious Polly, do I know him?"
3331_159609_000016_000000 "You have seen him."
3331_159609_000017_000000 "And is he very wise, good, and splendid, dear?"
3331_159609_000018_000000 "no"
3331_159609_000019_000000 "He ought to be if you love him.
3331_159609_000021_000001 Don't he love back again?"
3331_159609_000022_000000 "no
3331_159609_000023_000000 "I won't, but now I 'm not afraid to tell you that I think, I hope, I do believe that Sydney cares a little for me.
3331_159609_000023_000003 I try not to deceive myself, but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me."
3331_159609_000024_000000 "Thank heaven for that!" cried Polly, with the heartiest satisfaction in her voice.
3331_159609_000028_000000 "Oh, Polly, I am so glad!
3331_159609_000029_000000 "Could n't help it tried not to but it was so hard you know, Fan, you know," said a stifled voice from the depths of the very fuzzy cushion which Tom had once condemned.
3331_159609_000030_000001 The silence never lasts long, however, for the feminine desire to "talk it over" usually gets the better of the deepest emotion.
3331_159609_000031_000000 "Really my sister!
3331_159609_000035_000000 "What do you mean?
3331_159609_000036_000000 "Too late, let me tell you is that door shut, and Maud safe?"
3331_159609_000037_000000 Fanny reconnoitered, and returning, listened breathlessly, while Polly poured into her ear the bitter secret which was preying on her soul.
3331_159609_000039_000000 "Once or twice, but sort of jokingly, and I thought it was only some little flirtation.
3331_159609_000041_000000 Two great tears rolled down Polly's cheeks, and Fanny wiped them away, feeling an intense desire to go West by the next train, wither Maria Bailey with a single look, and bring Tom back as a gift to Polly.
3331_159609_000042_000001 But you see Tom always seems so like a boy, and you are more womanly for your age than any girl I know, so I never thought of your caring for him in that way.
3331_159609_000045_000002 Don't be so fierce, Polly; you quite frighten me."
3331_159609_000054_000001 What do you say Ned answered when you asked about this inconvenient girl?" said Fanny turning hopeful all at once.
3331_159609_000055_000001 Since then he has n't mentioned Maria, so I was sure there was something serious going on, and being in Tom's confidence, he kept quiet."
3331_159609_000056_000000 "It does look bad.
3331_159609_000056_000002 "I 'm willing, but you must let me see the letter.
3331_159609_000059_000000 "If it is true about Maria, what shall we do?" said Fanny after a pause.
3331_159609_000062_000000 "Then I shall wait." And Polly's face changed so beautifully that Fan hugged her on the spot, fervently wishing that Maria Bailey never had been born.
3331_159609_000064_000002 S." was a domestic man, and admired housewifely accomplishments.
3331_159609_000073_000000 "Prepare yourself somebody is engaged!" she said, in a solemn tone, that made Polly put up her hand as if to ward off an expected blow.
3528_168656_000003_000000 In the Little Convent there was a centenarian who came from the Abbey of Fontevrault.
3528_168656_000003_000001 She had even been in society before the Revolution.
3528_168656_000003_000003 She told wonders of the Abbey of Fontevrault,--that it was like a city, and that there were streets in the monastery.
3528_168656_000004_000000 She talked with a Picard accent which amused the pupils.
3528_168656_000005_000000 On another occasion, the centenarian was telling stories.
3528_168656_000005_000001 She said that in her youth the Bernardine monks were every whit as good as the mousquetaires.
3528_168656_000005_000002 It was a century which spoke through her, but it was the eighteenth century.
3528_168656_000005_000003 She told about the custom of the four wines, which existed before the Revolution in Champagne and Bourgogne.
3528_168656_000005_000004 When a great personage, a marshal of France, a prince, a duke, and a peer, traversed a town in Burgundy or Champagne, the city fathers came out to harangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which they had poured four different sorts of wine.
3528_168656_000005_000005 On the first goblet this inscription could be read, monkey wine; on the second, lion wine; on the third, sheep wine; on the fourth, hog wine.
3528_168656_000006_000000 In a cupboard, under lock and key, she kept a mysterious object of which she thought a great deal.
3528_168656_000006_000001 The rule of Fontevrault did not forbid this. She would not show this object to anyone.
3528_168656_000006_000002 She shut herself up, which her rule allowed her to do, and hid herself, every time that she desired to contemplate it.
3528_168656_000006_000003 If she heard a footstep in the corridor, she closed the cupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged hands.
3528_168656_000006_000005 The most curious were baffled by her silence and the most tenacious by her obstinacy.
3528_168656_000006_000006 Thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent.
3528_168656_000006_000008 Some unique chaplet?
3528_168656_000006_000009 Some authentic relic? They lost themselves in conjectures.
3528_168656_000006_000011 They found the object beneath a triple linen cloth, like some consecrated paten.
3528_168656_000006_000012 It was a Faenza platter representing little Loves flitting away pursued by apothecary lads armed with enormous syringes. The chase abounds in grimaces and in comical postures.
3528_168656_000006_000013 One of the charming little Loves is already fairly spitted.
3528_168656_000006_000014 He is resisting, fluttering his tiny wings, and still making an effort to fly, but the dancer is laughing with a satanical air.
3528_168656_000006_000015 Moral: Love conquered by the colic.
3528_168669_000000_000000 "The slab which closes the vault?"
3528_168669_000001_000000 "Yes."
3528_168669_000002_000000 "It would be a good thing to have two men for it."
3528_168669_000003_000000 "Mother Ascension, who is as strong as a man, will help you."
3528_168669_000004_000000 "A woman is never a man."
3528_168669_000005_000000 "We have only a woman here to help you.
3528_168669_000005_000001 Each one does what he can. Because Dom Mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of Saint Bernard, while Merlonus Horstius only gives three hundred and sixty seven, I do not despise Merlonus Horstius."
3528_168669_000006_000000 "Neither do i"
3528_168669_000007_000000 "Merit consists in working according to one's strength.
3528_168669_000007_000001 A cloister is not a dock yard."
3528_168669_000008_000001 But my brother is the strong one, though!"
3528_168669_000009_000000 "And can you get a lever?"
3528_168669_000010_000000 "That is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door."
3528_168669_000011_000000 "There is a ring in the stone."
3528_168669_000014_000000 "That is good, reverend Mother.
3528_168669_000014_000001 I will open the vault."
3528_168669_000015_000000 "And the four Mother Precentors will help you."
3528_168669_000016_000000 "And when the vault is open?"
3528_168669_000017_000000 "It must be closed again."
3528_168669_000018_000000 "Will that be all?"
3528_168669_000019_000000 "no"
3528_168669_000020_000000 "Give me your orders, very reverend Mother."
3528_168669_000022_000000 "I am here to do anything you wish."
3528_168669_000023_000000 "And to hold your peace about everything!"
3528_168669_000024_000000 "Yes, reverend Mother."
3528_168669_000025_000000 "When the vault is open-"
3528_168669_000027_000000 "But before that-"
3528_168669_000028_000000 "What, reverend Mother?"
3528_168669_000029_000000 "Something must be lowered into it."
3528_168669_000030_000000 A silence ensued.
3528_168669_000032_000000 "Reverend Mother!"
3528_168669_000033_000000 "You know that a mother died this morning?"
3528_168669_000034_000000 "no"
3528_168669_000035_000000 "Did you not hear the bell?"
3528_168669_000036_000000 "Nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden."
3528_168669_000037_000000 "Really?"
3528_168669_000038_000000 "I can hardly distinguish my own signal."
3528_168669_000039_000000 "She died at daybreak."
3528_168669_000040_000000 "And then, the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning."
3528_168669_000041_000000 "It was Mother Crucifixion.
3528_168669_000041_000001 A blessed woman."
3528_168669_000043_000000 "Three years ago, Madame de Bethune, a Jansenist, turned orthodox, merely from having seen Mother Crucifixion at prayer."
3528_168669_000044_000000 "Ah! yes, now I hear the knell, reverend Mother."
3528_168669_000045_000000 "The mothers have taken her to the dead room, which opens on the church."
3528_168669_000046_000000 "I know."
3528_168669_000047_000000 "No other man than you can or must enter that chamber.
3528_168669_000047_000001 See to that.
3528_168669_000047_000002 A fine sight it would be, to see a man enter the dead room!"
3528_168669_000048_000000 "More often!"
3528_168669_000049_000000 "Hey?"
3528_168669_000050_000000 "More often!"
3528_168669_000051_000000 "What do you say?"
3528_168669_000052_000000 "I say more often."
3528_168669_000053_000000 "More often than what?"
3528_168669_000054_000000 "Reverend Mother, I did not say more often than what, I said more often."
3528_168669_000055_000000 "I don't understand you.
3528_168669_000055_000001 Why do you say more often?"
3528_168669_000056_000000 "In order to speak like you, reverend Mother."
3528_168669_000057_000000 "But I did not say 'more often.'"
3528_168669_000058_000000 At that moment, nine o'clock struck.
3528_168669_000059_000000 "At nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours, praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar," said the prioress.
3528_168669_000061_000000 The clock struck opportunely.
3528_168669_000061_000001 It cut "more often" short.
3528_168669_000062_000000 Fauchelevent mopped his forehead.
3528_168669_000063_000000 The prioress indulged in another little inward murmur, probably sacred, then raised her voice:--
3528_168669_000064_000000 "In her lifetime, Mother Crucifixion made converts; after her death, she will perform miracles."
3528_168669_000065_000000 "She will!" replied Father Fauchelevent, falling into step, and striving not to flinch again.
3528_168669_000066_000002 She retained her consciousness to the very last moment. She spoke to us, then she spoke to the angels.
3528_168669_000066_000003 She gave us her last commands.
3528_168669_000066_000004 If you had a little more faith, and if you could have been in her cell, she would have cured your leg merely by touching it. She smiled.
3528_168669_000066_000005 We felt that she was regaining her life in God.
3528_168669_000066_000006 There was something of paradise in that death."
3528_168669_000067_000000 Fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing.
3528_168669_000068_000000 "Amen," said he.
3528_168669_000070_000000 The prioress took off several beads of her chaplet.
3528_168669_000070_000001 Fauchelevent held his peace.
3528_168669_000071_000000 She went on:--
3528_168669_000072_000000 "I have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in Our Lord, who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life, and who bear wonderful fruit."
3528_168669_000073_000000 "Reverend Mother, you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden."
3528_168669_000075_000000 "Like yourself, reverend Mother."
3528_168669_000078_000000 For a clever man like Fauchelevent, this allusion was an awkward one. Fortunately, the prioress, completely absorbed in her own thoughts, did not hear it.
3528_168669_000078_000001 She continued:--
3528_168669_000080_000000 "Reverend Mother?"
3528_168669_000082_000000 "Yes, reverend Mother."
3528_168669_000084_000000 "That is true."
3528_168669_000085_000000 "Saint Terentius, Bishop of Port, where the mouth of the Tiber empties into the sea, requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides, in the hope that passers by would spit on his tomb.
3528_168669_000085_000001 This was done.
3528_168669_000085_000002 The dead must be obeyed."
3528_168669_000086_000000 "So be it."
3528_168669_000088_000000 "For that matter, no, reverend Mother."
3528_168669_000089_000000 "The fact is attested by Plantavit de la Fosse."
3528_168669_000090_000000 Several beads of the chaplet were told off, still in silence.
3528_168669_000090_000001 The prioress resumed:--
3528_168669_000092_000000 "That is just."
3528_168669_000093_000000 "It is a continuation of her slumber."
3528_168669_000094_000000 "So I shall have to nail up that coffin?"
3528_168669_000095_000000 "Yes."
3528_168669_000096_000000 "And we are to reject the undertaker's coffin?"
3528_168669_000097_000000 "Precisely."
3528_168669_000098_000000 "I am at the orders of the very reverend community."
3528_168669_000099_000000 "The four Mother Precentors will assist you."
3528_168669_000100_000000 "In nailing up the coffin?
3528_168669_000100_000001 I do not need them."
3528_168669_000101_000000 "no
3528_168669_000101_000001 In lowering the coffin."
3528_168669_000102_000000 "Where?"
3528_168669_000103_000000 "Into the vault."
3528_168669_000105_000000 "Under the altar."
3528_168669_000106_000000 Fauchelevent started.
3528_168669_000107_000000 "The vault under the altar?"
3528_168669_000108_000000 "Under the altar."
3528_168669_000109_000000 "But-"
3528_168669_000110_000000 "You will have an iron bar."
3528_168669_000111_000000 "Yes, but-"
3528_168669_000112_000000 "You will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring."
3528_168669_000113_000000 "But-"
3528_168669_000114_000000 "The dead must be obeyed.
3528_168669_000114_000001 To be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel, not to go to profane earth; to remain there in death where she prayed while living; such was the last wish of Mother Crucifixion. She asked it of us; that is to say, commanded us."
3528_168669_000115_000000 "But it is forbidden."
3528_168669_000116_000000 "Forbidden by men, enjoined by God."
3528_168669_000117_000000 "What if it became known?"
3528_168669_000118_000000 "We have confidence in you."
3528_168669_000119_000000 "Oh!
3528_168669_000119_000001 I am a stone in your walls."
3528_168669_000120_000000 "The chapter assembled.
3528_168669_000120_000001 The vocal mothers, whom I have just consulted again, and who are now deliberating, have decided that Mother Crucifixion shall be buried, according to her wish, in her own coffin, under our altar.
3528_168669_000120_000003 What a glory of God for the community!
3528_168669_000120_000004 And miracles issue from tombs."
3528_168669_000122_000000 "Saint Benoit two., in the matter of sepulture, resisted Constantine Pogonatus."
3528_168669_000123_000000 "But the commissary of police-"
3528_168669_000124_000000 "Chonodemaire, one of the seven German kings who entered among the Gauls under the Empire of Constantius, expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion, that is to say, beneath the altar."
3528_168669_000125_000000 "But the inspector from the Prefecture-"
3528_168669_000126_000000 "The world is nothing in the presence of the cross.
3528_168669_000127_000000 "Amen," said Fauchelevent, who imperturbably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma, whenever he heard Latin.
3528_168669_000128_000000 Any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long.
3528_168669_000128_000002 The prioress, who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence, and whose reservoir was overfull, rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away:--
3528_168669_000129_000000 "I have on my right Benoit and on my left Bernard.
3528_168669_000129_000001 Who was Bernard?
3528_168669_000129_000003 Fontaines in Burgundy is a country that is blest because it gave him birth.
3528_168669_000129_000004 His father was named Tecelin, and his mother Alethe.
3528_168669_000129_000006 Who was Benoit?
3528_168669_000129_000008 His order has produced forty popes, two hundred cardinals, fifty patriarchs, sixteen hundred archbishops, four thousand six hundred bishops, four emperors, twelve empresses, forty six kings, forty one queens, three thousand six hundred canonized saints, and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years.
3528_168669_000129_000009 On one side Saint Bernard, on the other the agent of the sanitary department!
3528_168669_000129_000010 On one side Saint Benoit, on the other the inspector of public ways!
3528_168669_000129_000011 The state, the road commissioners, the public undertaker, regulations, the administration, what do we know of all that?
3528_168669_000129_000012 There is not a chance passer by who would not be indignant to see how we are treated.
3528_168669_000129_000013 We have not even the right to give our dust to Jesus Christ!
3528_168669_000129_000014 Your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention.
3528_168669_000129_000016 Silence, Fauvent!"
3528_168669_000130_000000 Fauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath.
3528_168669_000130_000001 The prioress continued:--
3528_168669_000131_000000 "No one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture.
3528_168669_000131_000001 Only fanatics and those in error deny it.
3528_168669_000131_000002 We live in times of terrible confusion.
3528_168669_000131_000003 We do not know that which it is necessary to know, and we know that which we should ignore.
3528_168669_000131_000007 Let us beware of God!
3528_168669_000131_000008 There is no longer just nor unjust.
3528_168669_000131_000009 The name of Voltaire is known, but not the name of Cesar de Bus.
3528_168669_000131_000010 Nevertheless, Cesar de Bus is a man of blessed memory, and Voltaire one of unblessed memory.
3528_168669_000131_000014 And then, religion is attacked.
3528_168669_000131_000015 Why? Because there have been bad priests, because Sagittaire, Bishop of Gap, was the brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, and because both of them followed Mommol.
3528_168669_000131_000017 Does that prevent Martin de Tours from being a saint, and giving half of his cloak to a beggar?
3528_168669_000131_000018 They persecute the saints.
3528_168669_000131_000019 They shut their eyes to the truth.
3528_168669_000131_000020 Darkness is the rule.
3528_168669_000131_000021 The most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind.
3528_168669_000131_000022 No one thinks of hell as a reality.
3528_168669_000131_000023 Oh! how wicked people are!
3528_168669_000131_000024 By order of the king signifies to day, by order of the revolution. One no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead.
3528_168669_000131_000025 A holy death is prohibited.
3528_168669_000131_000026 Burial is a civil matter.
3528_168669_000131_000027 This is horrible.
3528_168669_000131_000030 The ancient magistracy agreed with him.
3528_168669_000131_000031 In former times we had voices in the chapter, even on matters of the day.
3528_168669_000131_000032 The Abbot of Citeaux, the general of the order, was councillor by right of birth to the parliament of Burgundy.
3528_168669_000131_000035 All this is incontestable.
3528_168669_000134_000000 "It is settled, reverend Mother."
3528_168669_000135_000000 "We may depend on you?"
3528_168669_000136_000000 "I will obey."
3528_168669_000137_000000 "That is well."
3528_168669_000138_000000 "I am entirely devoted to the convent."
3528_168669_000139_000000 "That is understood.
3528_168669_000139_000001 You will close the coffin.
3528_168669_000139_000002 The sisters will carry it to the chapel.
3528_168669_000139_000003 The office for the dead will then be said.
3528_168669_000139_000004 Then we shall return to the cloister.
3528_168669_000139_000005 Between eleven o'clock and midnight, you will come with your iron bar.
3528_168669_000139_000006 All will be done in the most profound secrecy.
3528_168669_000139_000007 There will be in the chapel only the four Mother Precentors, Mother Ascension and yourself."
3528_168669_000140_000000 "And the sister at the post?"
3528_168669_000141_000000 "She will not turn round."
3528_168669_000142_000000 "But she will hear."
3528_168669_000143_000000 "She will not listen.
3528_168669_000143_000001 Besides, what the cloister knows the world learns not."
3528_168669_000144_000000 A pause ensued.
3528_168669_000144_000001 The prioress went on:--
3528_168669_000145_000000 "You will remove your bell.
3528_168669_000145_000001 It is not necessary that the sister at the post should perceive your presence."
3528_168669_000146_000000 "Reverend Mother?"
3528_168669_000148_000000 "Has the doctor for the dead paid his visit?"
3528_168669_000149_000000 "He will pay it at four o'clock to day.
3528_168669_000149_000001 The peal which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung.
3528_168669_000149_000002 But you do not understand any of the peals?"
3528_168669_000150_000000 "I pay no attention to any but my own."
3528_168669_000152_000000 "Reverend Mother, a lever at least six feet long will be required."
3528_168669_000153_000000 "Where will you obtain it?"
3528_168669_000154_000000 "Where gratings are not lacking, iron bars are not lacking.
3528_168669_000154_000001 I have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden."
3528_168669_000155_000000 "About three quarters of an hour before midnight; do not forget."
3528_168669_000156_000000 "Reverend Mother?"
3528_168669_000157_000000 "What?"
3528_168669_000158_000000 "If you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort, my brother is the strong man for you.
3528_168669_000158_000001 A perfect Turk!"
3528_168669_000159_000000 "You will do it as speedily as possible."
3528_168669_000160_000000 "I cannot work very fast.
3528_168669_000160_000001 I am infirm; that is why I require an assistant.
3528_168669_000161_000000 "To limp is no sin, and perhaps it is a blessing.
3528_168669_000163_000000 "Now that I think of it, Father Fauvent, let us give a whole hour to it. That is not too much.
3528_168669_000163_000001 Be near the principal altar, with your iron bar, at eleven o'clock.
3528_168669_000163_000002 The office begins at midnight.
3528_168669_000163_000003 Everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that."
3528_168669_000164_000000 "I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community.
3528_168669_000164_000001 These are my orders.
3528_168669_000164_000002 I am to nail up the coffin.
3528_168669_000164_000003 At eleven o'clock exactly, I am to be in the chapel.
3528_168669_000164_000004 The Mother Precentors will be there.
3528_168669_000164_000005 Mother Ascension will be there.
3528_168669_000164_000006 Two men would be better.
3528_168669_000164_000007 However, never mind!
3528_168669_000164_000008 I shall have my lever.
3528_168669_000164_000009 We will open the vault, we will lower the coffin, and we will close the vault again.
3528_168669_000164_000010 After which, there will be no trace of anything.
3528_168669_000164_000011 The government will have no suspicion.
3538_142836_000002_000000 CHAPTER thirty.
3538_142836_000003_000000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ICES, AND DESSERT DISHES.
3538_142836_000004_000000 PRESERVES.
3538_142836_000005_000000 fourteen ninety five.
3538_142836_000005_000006 It has long been a desideratum to preserve fruits by some cheap method, yet by such as would keep them fit for the various culinary purposes, as making tarts and other similar dishes.
3538_142836_000005_000007 The expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection; for, except the sugar is used in considerable quantities, the success is very uncertain. Sugar also overpowers and destroys the sub acid taste so desirable in many fruits: these which are preserved in this manner are chiefly intended for the dessert.
3538_142836_000005_000009 Until fruit can be used, it should be placed in the dairy, an ice house, or a refrigerator.
3538_142836_000005_000010 In an icehouse it will remain fresh and plump for several days.
3538_142836_000005_000011 Fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather will soon be mildewed, and be of no service for preserves.
3538_142836_000006_000000 fourteen ninety six.
3538_142836_000006_000003 But to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience.
3538_142836_000006_000004 The principal thing to be acquainted with is the fact, that, in proportion as the syrup is longer boiled, its water will become evaporated, and its consistency will be thicker.
3538_142836_000006_000005 Great care must be taken in the management of the fire, that the syrup does not boil over, and that the boiling is not carried to such an extent as to burn the sugar.
3538_142836_000007_000000 fourteen ninety seven.
3538_142836_000007_000007 The syrup employed should sometimes be clarified, which is done in the following manner:--Dissolve two pounds. of loaf sugar in a pint of water; add to this solution the white of an egg, and beat it well.
3538_142836_000007_000009 Let it boil up again; then take it off, and remove carefully the scum that has risen.
3538_142836_000007_000010 Boil the solution again, throw in a little more cold water, remove the scum, and so on for three or four times successively; then strain it.
3538_142836_000007_000011 It is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil.
3538_142836_000008_000000 fourteen ninety eight.
3538_142836_000008_000002 Before sugar was in use, honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions, though this substance has now given way to the juice of the sugar cane.
3538_142836_000009_000000 fourteen ninety nine.
3538_142836_000009_000003 When they have cooled, take them out and drain them.
3538_142836_000009_000005 Boil them up three days successively, skimming each time, and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use.
3538_142836_000009_000006 After each bailing, it is proper to examine into the state of the syrup when cold; if too thin, it will bear additional boiling; if too thick, it may be lowered with more syrup of the usual standard.
3538_142836_000009_000007 The reason why the fruit is emptied out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is, that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper, of which the preserving pans are usually made.
3538_142836_000010_000000 fifteen hundred.
3538_142836_000010_000003 Put more sugar on this, and then another layer of the slices, and so on till the jar is full.
3538_142836_000010_000005 Lastly, tie a wet bladder over the mouth of the jar, or cork and wax it.
3538_142836_000011_000000 fifteen o one.
3538_142836_000011_000001 Any of the fruits that have been preserved in syrup may be converted into dry preserves, by first draining them from the syrup, and then drying them in a stove or very moderate oven, adding to them a quantity of powdered loaf sugar, which will gradually penetrate the fruit, while the fluid parts of the syrup gently evaporate.
3538_142836_000011_000002 They should be dried in the stove or oven on a sieve, and turned every six or eight hours, fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they are turned.
3538_142836_000011_000005 In this way it is, also, that orange and lemon chips are preserved.
3538_142836_000012_000000 fifteen o two.
3538_142836_000012_000005 Fruit pastes are a kind of marmalades, consisting of the pulp of fruits, first evaporated to a proper consistency, and afterwards boiled with sugar.
3538_142836_000012_000009 That they may keep, it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar.
3538_142836_000013_000000 fifteen o three.
3538_142836_000013_000002 If the pan is placed close on to the fire, the preserve is very liable to burn, and the colour and flavour be consequently spoiled.
3538_142836_000014_000000 fifteen o four.
3538_142836_000015_000000 fifteen o five.
3538_142836_000016_000000 fifteen o six.
3538_142836_000017_000000 fifteen o seven.
3538_142836_000018_000000 CONFECTIONARY.
3538_142836_000019_000000 fifteen o eight.
3538_142836_000019_000002 The thousand and one ornamental dishes that adorn the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner: they cannot profitably be made at home.
3538_142836_000020_000000 DESSERT DISHES.
3538_142836_000021_000000 fifteen o nine.
3538_142836_000021_000003 However, as late as the reigns of our two last Georges, fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts.
3538_142836_000021_000006 The shape of the dishes varies at different periods, the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems.
3538_142836_000021_000007 The patterns and colours are also subject to changes of fashion; some persons selecting china, chaste in pattern and colour; others, elegantly shaped glass dishes on stems, with gilt edges.
3538_142836_000021_000010 The garnishing needs especial attention, as the contrast of the brilliant coloured fruits with nicely arranged foliage is very charming.
3538_142836_000021_000015 A dessert would not now be considered complete without candied and preserved fruits and confections.
3538_142836_000021_000017 They are preserved abroad in most ornamental and elegant forms.
3538_142836_000022_000000 ICES.
3538_142836_000023_000001 Ices are composed, it is scarcely necessary to say, of congealed cream or water, combined sometimes with liqueurs or other flavouring ingredients, or more generally with the juices of fruits.
3538_142836_000023_000002 At desserts, or at some evening parties, ices are scarcely to be dispensed with.
3538_142836_000023_000003 The principal utensils required for making ice creams are ice tubs, freezing pots, spaddles, and a cellaret.
3538_142836_000023_000006 The spaddle is generally made of copper, kept bright and clean.
3538_142836_000023_000008 The method to be pursued in the freezing process must be attended to.
3538_142836_000023_000009 When the ice tub is prepared with fresh pounded ice and salt, the freezing pot is put into it up to its cover.
3538_142836_000023_000012 The use of the spaddle is to stir up and remove from the sides of the freezing pot the cream, which in the shaking may have washed against it, and by stirring it in with the rest, to prevent waste of it occurring.
3538_142836_000024_000001 The aged, the delicate, and children should abstain from ices or iced beverages; even the strong and healthy should partake of them in moderation.
3538_142836_000024_000003 It is necessary, then, that this function should have scarcely commenced, or that it should be completely finished, before partaking of ices.
3538_163619_000001_000000 BUSHY BRIDE
3538_163619_000002_000001 They were both good children, and loved each other with all their hearts.
3538_163619_000002_000002 After some time had gone by the man married again, and he chose a widow with one daughter who was ugly and wicked, and her mother was ugly and wicked too.
3538_163619_000004_000000 But his sister, who was still at home, fared worse and worse.
3538_163619_000004_000001 Both her step mother and her step sister were always finding fault with her, whatsoever she did and whithersoever she went, and they scolded her and abused her so that she never had an hour's peace.
3538_163619_000004_000002 They made her do all the hard work, and hard words fell to her lot early and late, but little enough food accompanied them.
3538_163619_000005_000000 One day they sent her to the brook to fetch some water home, and an ugly and horrible head rose up out of the water, and said, 'Wash me, girl!'
3538_163619_000007_000000 'Brush me, girl!' said the head.
3538_163619_000010_000000 'Kiss me, girl!' said the head.
3538_163619_000011_000000 'Yes, I will kiss you,' said the man's daughter, and she did it, but she thought it was the worst bit of work that she had ever had to do in her life.
3538_163619_000012_000000 So the heads all began to talk to each other, and to ask what they should do for this girl who was so full of kindliness.
3538_163619_000013_000000 'She shall be the prettiest girl that ever was, and fair and bright as the day,' said the first head.
3538_163619_000016_000001 The step mother fell into such a towering passion that she drove the man's daughter into the pig stye-she might stay there with her fine show of gold, the step mother said, but she should not be permitted to set foot in the house.
3538_163619_000018_000000 When she got there with her pails, the first head rose up out of the water close to the bank.
3538_163619_000018_000001 'Wash me, girl!' it said.
3538_163619_000019_000000 'Wash yourself!' answered the woman's daughter.
3538_163619_000020_000000 Then the second head appeared.
3538_163619_000024_000000 'Kiss me, girl!' said the head.
3538_163619_000025_000000 'As if I would kiss your ugly mouth!' said the girl.
3538_163619_000029_000000 'I can't get near, because of my nose,' said the daughter.
3538_163619_000032_000001 At first the King would not believe this, but after a long, long time, they prevailed with him, and he crept on tip toe to the door, peeped through, and saw the youth on his knees, with his hands clasped together before a picture which was hanging on the wall.
3538_163619_000033_000000 'Open the door!' cried the King, but the youth did not hear.
3538_163619_000035_000001 'It is I! I want to come in.'
3538_163619_000037_000000 When the King entered and saw it, he stood still as if he were in fetters, and could not stir from the spot, for the picture seemed to him so beautiful.
3538_163619_000038_000000 'There is nowhere on earth so beautiful a woman as this!' said the King.
3538_163619_000041_000000 When the brother arrived at home to fetch his sister, her stepmother and step sister would go too.
3538_163619_000041_000002 These two things were all that she had inherited from her mother.
3538_163619_000041_000004 At last they came in sight of land.
3538_163619_000044_000000 'He says that you are to throw your casket out into the sea,' answered the step mother.
3538_163619_000045_000000 'Well, if my brother says so, I must do it,' said the man's daughter, and she flung her casket into the sea.
3538_163619_000047_000000 'What is my brother saying?' asked the man's daughter.
3538_163619_000049_000000 The man's daughter wept, and was sorely troubled, for Little Snow was the dearest thing she had on earth, but at last she threw him overboard.
3538_163619_000051_000000 So they sailed onwards a long way farther.
3538_163619_000053_000000 'What is my brother saying?' asked his sister again.
3538_163619_000054_000000 'Now he says that you are to make haste and throw yourself overboard,' answered the step mother.
3538_163619_000055_000000 She wept and she wailed, but as her brother had said that, she thought she must do it; so she leaped into the sea.
3538_163619_000057_000000 But he was very wroth, and none can blame him for that; so he caused the brother to be thrown into a pit full of snakes.
3538_163619_000058_000000 On the first Thursday night after this, a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace, and begged the kitchen maid, who slept there, to lend her a brush.
3538_163619_000060_000001 Then she was forced to depart, but as she went she said:
3538_163619_000062_000000 I shall come twice more, and then never again,' said she.
3538_163619_000063_000001 But though he rubbed his eyes and did everything he could to keep himself awake it was all in vain, for the Bushy Bride crooned and sang till his eyes were fast closed, and when the beautiful young maiden came he was sound asleep and snoring.
3538_163619_000064_000000 This time also, as before, she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it, and the gold dropped down as she did it; and again she sent the dog out three times, and when day dawned she departed, but as she was going she said as she had said before, 'I shall come once more, and then never again.'
3538_163619_000065_000004 The third time it was just beginning to grow light, and then she said:
3538_163619_000067_000000 'Now I shall never come again,' she said, and then she turned to go.
3538_163622_000004_000000 THE SEVEN FOALS
3538_163622_000005_000001 They only just managed to live from hand to mouth, and had great difficulty in doing even so much as that, but they had three sons, and the youngest of them was called Cinderlad, for he did nothing else but lie and poke about among the ashes.
3538_163622_000006_000000 One day the eldest lad said that he would go out to earn his living; he soon got leave to do that, and set out on his way into the world.
3538_163622_000006_000001 He walked on and on for the whole day, and when night was beginning to fall he came to a royal palace.
3538_163622_000011_000000 As soon as she caught sight of the youth, who was running after the foals till the perspiration streamed down his face, she cried:
3538_163622_000012_000000 'Come hither, come hither, my handsome son, and let me comb your hair for you.'
3538_163622_000014_000000 When evening was drawing near, the youth wanted to go.
3538_163622_000019_000000 'Yes, that I have!' said the youth.
3538_163622_000022_000000 'Here you see their meat, and here you see their drink.'
3538_163622_000023_000000 Then the King knew how his watching had been done, and fell into such a rage that he ordered his people to chase the youth back to his own home at once; but first they were to cut three red stripes in his back, and rub salt into them.
3538_163622_000024_000000 When the youth reached home again, anyone can imagine what a state of mind he was in.
3538_163622_000027_000000 In the grey light of dawn the Master of the Horse let out the seven foals, and off they went again over hill and dale, and off went the lad after them.
3538_163622_000027_000001 But all went with him as it had gone with his brother.
3538_163622_000027_000002 When he had run after the foals for a long, long time and was hot and tired, he passed by a cleft in the rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with a distaff, and she called to him:
3538_163622_000031_000000 On the third day Cinderlad wanted to set out.
3538_163622_000031_000001 He had a fancy to try to watch the seven foals himself, he said.
3538_163622_000032_000000 The two others laughed at him, and mocked him.
3538_163622_000033_000000 'Yes, I will go too,' said Cinderlad, 'for I have taken it into my head.'
3538_163622_000034_000000 The two brothers laughed at him, and his father and mother begged him not to go, but all to no purpose, and Cinderlad set out on his way.
3538_163622_000034_000001 So when he had walked the whole day, he too came to the King's palace as darkness began to fall.
3538_163622_000035_000000 There stood the King outside on the steps, and he asked whither he was bound.
3538_163622_000036_000000 'I am walking about in search of a place,' said Cinderlad.
3538_163622_000038_000000 So Cinderlad told him whence he came, and that he was brother to the two who had watched the seven foals for the King, and then he inquired if he might be allowed to try to watch them on the following day.
3538_163622_000043_000001 When he had run thus for a long time, he too came to the cleft in the rock.
3538_163622_000043_000002 There the old hag was once more sitting spinning from her distaff, and she cried to Cinderlad;
3538_163622_000048_000000 And thus they journeyed onwards a long, long way.
3538_163622_000050_000000 'No,' said Cinderlad.
3538_163622_000051_000000 So they journeyed onwards a good bit farther.
3538_163622_000053_000000 'Oh, no,' said the lad.
3538_163622_000055_000000 'Dost thou see anything now?'
3538_163622_000057_000000 'Yes, that is where we are to go in,' said the Foal.
3538_163622_000059_000000 'Canst thou wield that sword?' asked the Foal.
3538_163622_000060_000000 Cinderlad tried, but could not do it; so he had to take a draught from the pitcher, and then one more, and after that still another, and then he was able to wield the sword with perfect ease.
3538_163622_000062_000000 Cinderlad promised to do this, and then they went on farther.
3538_163622_000063_000000 When they had travelled a long, long way, the Foal said:
3538_163622_000064_000000 'Dost thou see anything?'
3538_163622_000065_000000 'No,' said Cinderlad.
3538_163622_000066_000000 So they went on a great distance farther.
3538_163622_000067_000000 'And now?' inquired the Foal, 'seest thou nothing now?'
3538_163622_000068_000000 'Alas! no,' said Cinderlad.
3538_163622_000069_000000 So they travelled onwards again, for many and many a mile, over hill and dale.
3538_163622_000070_000000 'Now, then,' said the Foal, 'dost thou not see anything now?'
3538_163622_000072_000000 'That is a river,' said the Foal, 'and we have to cross it.'
3538_163622_000075_000000 When the Foals got into the churchyard they turned into men and looked like the sons of a king, and their clothes were so magnificent that they shone with splendour, and they went into the church and received bread and wine from the priest, who was standing before the altar, and Cinderlad went in too.
3538_163622_000077_000000 It was all but dark when they got back to the King at nightfall, and he himself was standing in the courtyard waiting for them.
3538_163622_000078_000000 'Hast thou watched well and faithfully the whole day?' said the King to Cinderlad.
3538_163622_000079_000000 'I have done my best,' replied Cinderlad.
3538_163622_000082_000000 'Yes, diligently and faithfully hast thou watched,' said the King, 'and thou shalt have the Princess and half the kingdom.'
3538_163622_000083_000000 So all was made ready for the wedding, and the King said that it was to be so stately and magnificent that everyone should hear of it, and everyone inquire about it.
3538_163624_000006_000000 THE STORY OF SIGURD
3538_163624_000007_000001 They have carved on the rocks pictures of some of the things that happen in the tale, and those carvings may still be seen.
3538_163624_000007_000002 Because it is so old and so beautiful the story is told here again, but it has a sad ending-indeed it is all sad, and all about fighting and killing, as might be expected from the Danes.)
3538_163624_000008_000000 ONCE upon a time there was a King in the North who had won many wars, but now he was old.
3538_163624_000008_000002 The old King went out and fought bravely, but at last his sword broke, and he was wounded and his men fled.
3538_163624_000008_000003 But in the night, when the battle was over, his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain, and at last she found him, and asked whether he might be healed.
3538_163624_000008_000004 But he said 'No,' his luck was gone, his sword was broken, and he must die.
3538_163624_000009_000000 Then he died.
3538_163624_000009_000001 And his wife called her maid to her and said, 'Let us change clothes, and you shall be called by my name, and I by yours, lest the enemy finds us.'
3538_163624_000010_000000 So this was done, and they hid in a wood, but there some strangers met them and carried them off in a ship to Denmark.
3538_163624_000010_000001 And when they were brought before the King, he thought the maid looked like a Queen, and the Queen like a maid.
3538_163624_000010_000002 So he asked the Queen, 'How do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning?'
3538_163624_000011_000000 And she said:
3538_163624_000013_000000 'A strange Queen to light the fires,' thought the King.
3538_163624_000015_000000 'My father gave me a gold ring,' said she, 'and always, ere the dawning, it grows cold on my finger.'
3538_163624_000016_000000 'A rich house where the maids wore gold,' said the King. 'Truly you are no maid, but a King's daughter.'
3538_163624_000017_000000 So he treated her royally, and as time went on she had a son called Sigurd, a beautiful boy and very strong.
3538_163624_000017_000001 He had a tutor to be with him, and once the tutor bade him go to the King and ask for a horse.
3538_163624_000019_000000 Then the old man said, 'Drive all the horses into the river, and choose the one that swims across.'
3538_163624_000020_000000 So Sigurd drove them, and only one swam across.
3538_163624_000020_000001 Sigurd chose him: his name was Grani, and he came of Sleipnir's breed, and was the best horse in the world.
3538_163624_000020_000002 For Sleipnir was the horse of Odin, the God of the North, and was as swift as the wind.
3538_163624_000021_000000 But a day or two later his tutor said to Sigurd, 'There is a great treasure of gold hidden not far from here, and it would become you to win it.'
3538_163624_000025_000000 Then his tutor, whose name was Regin, told him that all this great hoard of red gold had once belonged to his own father.
3538_163624_000026_000000 Now there was at that time a dwarf called Andvari, who lived in a pool beneath a waterfall, and there he had hidden a great hoard of gold.
3538_163624_000026_000001 And one day Otter had been fishing there, and had killed a salmon and eaten it, and was sleeping, like an otter, on a stone.
3538_163624_000026_000004 Then the person who had killed Otter went down and caught the Dwarf who owned all the treasure and took it from him.
3538_163624_000027_000000 Only one ring was left, which the Dwarf wore, and even that was taken from him.
3538_163624_000029_000000 Then the otter skin was filled with gold and covered with gold, all but one hair, and that was covered with the poor Dwarf's last ring.
3538_163624_000030_000000 But it brought good luck to nobody.
3538_163624_000030_000001 First Fafnir, the Dragon, killed his own father, and then he went and wallowed on the gold, and would let his brother have none, and no man dared go near it.
3538_163624_000031_000000 When Sigurd heard the story he said to Regin:
3538_163624_000032_000000 'Make me a good sword that I may kill this Dragon.'
3538_163624_000033_000000 So Regin made a sword, and Sigurd tried it with a blow on a lump of iron, and the sword broke.
3538_163624_000034_000000 Another sword he made, and Sigurd broke that too.
3538_163624_000035_000001 And he hammered and wrought them into a new sword, so sharp that fire seemed to burn along its edges.
3538_163624_000036_000000 Sigurd tried this blade on the lump of iron, and it did not break, but split the iron in two.
3538_163624_000036_000001 Then he threw a lock of wool into the river, and when it floated down against the sword it was cut into two pieces.
3538_163624_000036_000002 So Sigurd said that sword would do.
3538_163624_000037_000000 When he had been at home a few days, he rode out with Regin one morning to the heath where the Dragon used to lie.
3538_163624_000037_000001 Then he saw the track which the Dragon made when he went to a cliff to drink, and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley.
3538_163624_000038_000000 Then Sigurd went down into that deep place, and dug many pits in it, and in one of the pits he lay hidden with his sword drawn.
3538_163624_000038_000001 There he waited, and presently the earth began to shake with the weight of the Dragon as he crawled to the water.
3538_163624_000039_000000 But Sigurd waited till half of him had crawled over the pit, and then he thrust the sword Gram right into his very heart.
3538_163624_000040_000000 Then the Dragon lashed with his tail till stones broke and trees crashed about him.
3538_163624_000041_000000 Then he spoke, as he died, and said:
3538_163624_000043_000000 Sigurd said:
3538_163624_000044_000000 'I would touch none of it if by losing it I should never die.
3538_163624_000044_000001 But all men die, and no brave man lets death frighten him from his desire.
3538_163624_000045_000000 And after that Sigurd was called Fafnir's Bane, and Dragonslayer.
3538_163624_000047_000000 So Sigurd put the heart of Fafnir on a stake, and roasted it.
3538_163624_000047_000001 But it chanced that he touched it with his finger, and it burned him.
3538_163624_000048_000000 Then immediately he understood the language of birds, and he heard the Woodpeckers say:
3538_163624_000050_000000 The next bird said:
3538_163624_000051_000000 'There lies Regin, ready to betray Sigurd, who trusts him.'
3538_163624_000052_000000 The third bird said:
3538_163624_000054_000000 The fourth bird said:
3538_163624_000059_000000 'High over Hindfell Red fire is flaming, There doth the maiden dwell She that should love thee well, Meet for thy taming.
3538_163624_000061_000000 Then Sigurd remembered how the story went that somewhere, far away, there was a beautiful lady enchanted.
3538_163624_000061_000003 And Fafnir had lived in a cave with iron doors, a cave dug deep down in the earth, and full of gold bracelets, and crowns, and rings; and there, too, Sigurd found the Helm of Dread, a golden helmet, and whoever wears it is invisible.
3538_163624_000061_000004 All these he piled on the back of the good horse Grani, and then he rode south to Hindfell.
3538_163624_000062_000002 So Sigurd went within the castle door, and there he saw someone sleeping, clad all in armour.
3538_163624_000062_000003 Then he took the helmet off the head of the sleeper, and behold, she was a most beautiful lady.
3538_163624_000063_000000 This curse came upon her when the thorn of the tree of sleep ran into her hand long ago as a punishment because she had displeased Odin the God.
3538_163624_000063_000001 Long ago, too, she had vowed never to marry a man who knew fear, and dared not ride through the fence of flaming fire.
3538_163624_000063_000003 But now she and Sigurd loved each other, and promised to be true to each other, and he gave her a ring, and it was the last ring taken from the dwarf Andvari.
3538_163624_000063_000004 Then Sigurd rode away, and he came to the house of a King who had a fair daughter.
3538_163624_000064_000003 Then Gunnar tried Sigurd's horse Grani, but he would not move with Gunnar on his back.
3538_163624_000065_000000 Now Brynhild had no help but to promise she would be his wife, the wife of Gunnar as she supposed, for Sigurd wore Gunnar's shape, and she had sworn to wed whoever should ride the flames.
3538_163624_000065_000004 'Yet I thought,' she said, 'that no man could have done this deed but Sigurd, Fafnir's bane, who was my true love.
3538_163624_000065_000005 But he has forgotten me, and my promise I must keep.'
3538_163624_000066_000000 So Gunnar and Brynhild were married, though it was not Gunnar but Sigurd in Gunnar's shape, that had ridden the fire.
3538_163624_000067_000000 And when the wedding was over and all the feast, then the magic of the witch's wine went out of Sigurd's brain, and he remembered all.
3538_163624_000068_000000 But he was brave, and he spoke not a word of it to the others to make them unhappy.
3538_163624_000069_000002 For her husband, she said, had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it.
3538_163624_000071_000000 Then Brynhild saw the ring which Sigard had given to Gudrun, and she knew it and knew all, and she turned as pale as a dead woman, and went home.
3538_163624_000071_000001 All that evening she never spoke.
3538_163624_000071_000003 And she said he would never see her glad in his hall, never drinking wine, never playing chess, never embroidering with the golden thread, never speaking words of kindness.
3538_163624_000071_000004 Then she rent all her needlework asunder and wept aloud, so that everyone in the house heard her.
3538_163624_000075_000000 'It is too late.'
3538_163624_000076_000000 Then Sigurd was so grieved and his heart so swelled in his breast that it burst the steel rings of his shirt of mail.
3538_163624_000077_000000 Sigurd went out and Brynhild determined to slay him.
3538_163624_000077_000003 Thus died Sigurd, Fafnir's bane, whom no ten men could have slain in fair fight.
3538_163624_000077_000004 Then Gudrun wakened and saw him dead, and she moaned aloud, and Brynhild heard her and laughed; but the kind horse Grani lay down and died of very grief.
3538_163624_000077_000005 And then Brynhild fell a weeping till her heart broke.
3538_163624_000077_000007 And the wind bore it blazing out to sea, flaming into the dark.
3570_5694_000004_000000 In what has been said of the evolution of the vicarious leisure class and its differentiation from the general body of the working classes, reference has been made to a further division of labour,--that between the different servant classes.
3570_5694_000005_000000 But already at a point in economic evolution far antedating the emergence of the lady, specialised consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system.
3570_5694_000005_000001 The beginning of a differentiation in consumption even antedates the appearance of anything that can fairly be called pecuniary strength. It is traceable back to the initial phase of predatory culture, and there is even a suggestion that an incipient differentiation in this respect lies back of the beginnings of the predatory life.
3570_5694_000005_000002 This most primitive differentiation in the consumption of goods is like the later differentiation with which we are all so intimately familiar, in that it is largely of a ceremonial character, but unlike the latter it does not rest on a difference in accumulated wealth.
3570_5694_000005_000003 The utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth.
3570_5694_000005_000004 It is an adaption to a new end, by a selective process, of a distinction previously existing and well established in men's habits of thought.
3570_5694_000006_000000 In the earlier phases of the predatory culture the only economic differentiation is a broad distinction between an honourable superior class made up of the able bodied men on the one side, and a base inferior class of labouring women on the other.
3570_5694_000006_000002 Such consumption as falls to the women is merely incidental to their work; it is a means to their continued labour, and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fulness of life.
3570_5694_000006_000004 The consumption of choice articles of food, and frequently also of rare articles of adornment, becomes tabu to the women and children; and if there is a base (servile) class of men, the tabu holds also for them.
3570_5694_000006_000005 With a further advance in culture this tabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character; but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained, whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality, the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily.
3570_5694_000006_000006 When the quasi peaceable stage of industry is reached, with its fundamental institution of chattel slavery, the general principle, more or less rigorously applied, is that the base, industrious class should consume only what may be necessary to their subsistence.
3570_5694_000006_000007 In the nature of things, luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class.
3570_5694_000006_000008 Under the tabu, certain victuals, and more particularly certain beverages, are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class.
3570_5694_000007_000001 If these articles of consumption are costly, they are felt to be noble and honorific.
3570_5694_000007_000002 Therefore the base classes, primarily the women, practice an enforced continence with respect to these stimulants, except in countries where they are obtainable at a very low cost.
3570_5694_000007_000003 From archaic times down through all the length of the patriarchal regime it has been the office of the women to prepare and administer these luxuries, and it has been the perquisite of the men of gentle birth and breeding to consume them.
3570_5694_000007_000004 Drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific, as being a mark, at the second remove, of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence.
3570_5694_000007_000005 Infirmities induced by over indulgence are among some peoples freely recognised as manly attributes.
3570_5694_000007_000006 It has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for "noble" or "gentle".
3570_5694_000007_000008 The same invidious distinction adds force to the current disapproval of any indulgence of this kind on the part of women, minors, and inferiors.
3570_5694_000007_000009 This invidious traditional distinction has not lost its force even among the more advanced peoples of today.
3570_5694_000007_000010 Where the example set by the leisure class retains its imperative force in the regulation of the conventionalities, it is observable that the women still in great measure practise the same traditional continence with regard to stimulants.
3570_5694_000008_000000 This characterisation of the greater continence in the use of stimulants practised by the women of the reputable classes may seem an excessive refinement of logic at the expense of common sense.
3570_5694_000008_000001 But facts within easy reach of any one who cares to know them go to say that the greater abstinence of women is in some part due to an imperative conventionality; and this conventionality is, in a general way, strongest where the patriarchal tradition-the tradition that the woman is a chattel-has retained its hold in greatest vigour.
3570_5694_000008_000002 In a sense which has been greatly qualified in scope and rigour, but which has by no means lost its meaning even yet, this tradition says that the woman, being a chattel, should consume only what is necessary to her sustenance,--except so far as her further consumption contributes to the comfort or the good repute of her master.
3570_5694_000008_000003 The consumption of luxuries, in the true sense, is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself, and is, therefore, a mark of the master.
3570_5694_000008_000004 Any such consumption by others can take place only on a basis of sufferance.
3570_5694_000008_000007 With many qualifications-with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakened-the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters.
3570_5694_000008_000008 The objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule; but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial.
3570_5694_000008_000009 During the earlier stages of economic development, consumption of goods without stint, especially consumption of the better grades of goods,--ideally all consumption in excess of the subsistence minimum,--pertains normally to the leisure class.
3570_5694_000008_000010 This restriction tends to disappear, at least formally, after the later peaceable stage has been reached, with private ownership of goods and an industrial system based on wage labour or on the petty household economy.
3570_5694_000008_000011 But during the earlier quasi peaceable stage, when so many of the traditions through which the institution of a leisure class has affected the economic life of later times were taking form and consistency, this principle has had the force of a conventional law.
3570_5694_000008_000012 It has served as the norm to which consumption has tended to conform, and any appreciable departure from it is to be regarded as an aberrant form, sure to be eliminated sooner or later in the further course of development.
3570_5694_000009_000001 He consumes freely and of the best, in food, drink, narcotics, shelter, services, ornaments, apparel, weapons and accoutrements, amusements, amulets, and idols or divinities. In the process of gradual amelioration which takes place in the articles of his consumption, the motive principle and proximate aim of innovation is no doubt the higher efficiency of the improved and more elaborate products for personal comfort and well-being.
3570_5694_000009_000002 But that does not remain the sole purpose of their consumption.
3570_5694_000009_000003 The canon of reputability is at hand and seizes upon such innovations as are, according to its standard, fit to survive.
3570_5694_000009_000004 Since the consumption of these more excellent goods is an evidence of wealth, it becomes honorific; and conversely, the failure to consume in due quantity and quality becomes a mark of inferiority and demerit.
3570_5694_000010_000000 This growth of punctilious discrimination as to qualitative excellence in eating, drinking, etc presently affects not only the manner of life, but also the training and intellectual activity of the gentleman of leisure.
3570_5694_000010_000001 He is no longer simply the successful, aggressive male,--the man of strength, resource, and intrepidity.
3570_5694_000010_000002 In order to avoid stultification he must also cultivate his tastes, for it now becomes incumbent on him to discriminate with some nicety between the noble and the ignoble in consumable goods.
3570_5694_000010_000003 He becomes a connoisseur in creditable viands of various degrees of merit, in manly beverages and trinkets, in seemly apparel and architecture, in weapons, games, dancers, and the narcotics.
3570_5694_000010_000004 This cultivation of aesthetic faculty requires time and application, and the demands made upon the gentleman in this direction therefore tend to change his life of leisure into a more or less arduous application to the business of learning how to live a life of ostensible leisure in a becoming way.
3570_5694_000010_000005 Closely related to the requirement that the gentleman must consume freely and of the right kind of goods, there is the requirement that he must know how to consume them in a seemly manner.
3570_5694_000010_000006 His life of leisure must be conducted in due form.
3570_5694_000010_000007 Hence arise good manners in the way pointed out in an earlier chapter.
3570_5694_000010_000008 High bred manners and ways of living are items of conformity to the norm of conspicuous leisure and conspicuous consumption.
3570_5694_000011_000000 Conspicuous consumption of valuable goods is a means of reputability to the gentleman of leisure.
3570_5694_000011_000001 As wealth accumulates on his hands, his own unaided effort will not avail to sufficiently put his opulence in evidence by this method.
3570_5694_000011_000002 The aid of friends and competitors is therefore brought in by resorting to the giving of valuable presents and expensive feasts and entertainments.
3570_5694_000011_000003 Presents and feasts had probably another origin than that of naive ostentation, but they required their utility for this purpose very early, and they have retained that character to the present; so that their utility in this respect has now long been the substantial ground on which these usages rest.
3570_5694_000011_000004 Costly entertainments, such as the potlatch or the ball, are peculiarly adapted to serve this end.
3570_5694_000011_000005 The competitor with whom the entertainer wishes to institute a comparison is, by this method, made to serve as a means to the end.
3570_5694_000011_000006 He consumes vicariously for his host at the same time that he is witness to the consumption of that excess of good things which his host is unable to dispose of single handed, and he is also made to witness his host's facility in etiquette.
3570_5694_000012_000001 The custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion; these motives are also present in the later development, but they do not continue to be the sole motives.
3570_5694_000012_000002 The latter day leisure class festivities and entertainments may continue in some slight degree to serve the religious need and in a higher degree the needs of recreation and conviviality, but they also serve an invidious purpose; and they serve it none the less effectually for having a colorable non invidious ground in these more avowable motives.
3570_5694_000012_000003 But the economic effect of these social amenities is not therefore lessened, either in the vicarious consumption of goods or in the exhibition of difficult and costly achievements in etiquette.
3570_5694_000013_000000 As wealth accumulates, the leisure class develops further in function and structure, and there arises a differentiation within the class. There is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades.
3570_5694_000013_000001 This differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility.
3570_5694_000013_000003 Hence results a class of impecunious gentlemen of leisure, incidentally referred to already. These half caste gentlemen of leisure fall into a system of hierarchical gradations.
3570_5694_000013_000004 Those who stand near the higher and the highest grades of the wealthy leisure class, in point of birth, or in point of wealth, or both, outrank the remoter born and the pecuniarily weaker.
3570_5694_000013_000006 They become his courtiers or retainers, servants; and being fed and countenanced by their patron they are indices of his rank and vicarious consumer of his superfluous wealth.
3570_5694_000013_000007 Many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lesser men of substance in their own right; so that some of them are scarcely at all, others only partially, to be rated as vicarious consumers.
3570_5694_000013_000008 So many of them, however, as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification.
3570_5694_000014_000002 As regards feasts and largesses this is obvious enough, and the imputation of repute to the host or patron here takes place immediately, on the ground of common notoriety.
3570_5694_000014_000004 As the group whose good esteem is to be secured in this way grows larger, more patent means are required to indicate the imputation of merit for the leisure performed, and to this end uniforms, badges, and liveries come into vogue.
3570_5694_000014_000005 The wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence, and may even be said to be a mark of servitude, real or ostensible.
3570_5694_000014_000006 The wearers of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes the free and the servile, or the noble and the ignoble.
3570_5694_000014_000007 The services performed by them are likewise divisible into noble and ignoble.
3570_5694_000014_000008 Of course the distinction is not observed with strict consistency in practice; the less debasing of the base services and the less honorific of the noble functions are not infrequently merged in the same person.
3570_5694_000014_000009 But the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked.
3570_5694_000014_000012 On the other hand, those employments which properly fall to the industrious class are ignoble; such as handicraft or other productive labor, menial services and the like.
3570_5694_000014_000013 But a base service performed for a person of very high degree may become a very honorific office; as for instance the office of a Maid of Honor or of a Lady in Waiting to the Queen, or the King's Master of the Horse or his Keeper of the Hounds.
3570_5694_000014_000014 The two offices last named suggest a principle of some general bearing.
3570_5694_000014_000015 Whenever, as in these cases, the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting, it easily acquires a reflected honorific character.
3570_5694_000014_000018 Vicarious consumption by dependents bearing the insignia of their patron or master narrows down to a corps of liveried menials.
3570_5694_000014_000019 In a heightened degree, therefore, the livery comes to be a badge of servitude, or rather servility.
3570_5694_000014_000021 The livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it.
3570_5694_000014_000022 We are yet so little removed from a state of effective slavery as still to be fully sensitive to the sting of any imputation of servility.
3570_5694_000014_000023 This antipathy asserts itself even in the case of the liveries or uniforms which some corporations prescribe as the distinctive dress of their employees.
3570_5695_000000_000000 With the disappearance of servitude, the number of vicarious consumers attached to any one gentleman tends, on the whole, to decrease.
3570_5695_000000_000002 In a general way, though not wholly nor consistently, these two groups coincide.
3570_5695_000000_000004 But as we descend the social scale, the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone.
3570_5695_000001_000000 And here occurs a curious inversion.
3570_5695_000001_000001 It is a fact of common observance that in this lower middle class there is no pretense of leisure on the part of the head of the household.
3570_5695_000001_000002 Through force of circumstances it has fallen into disuse.
3570_5695_000001_000003 But the middle class wife still carries on the business of vicarious leisure, for the good name of the household and its master.
3570_5695_000001_000004 In descending the social scale in any modern industrial community, the primary fact the conspicuous leisure of the master of the household disappears at a relatively high point.
3570_5695_000001_000005 The head of the middle class household has been reduced by economic circumstances to turn his hand to gaining a livelihood by occupations which often partake largely of the character of industry, as in the case of the ordinary business man of today.
3570_5695_000001_000006 But the derivative fact the vicarious leisure and consumption rendered by the wife, and the auxiliary vicarious performance of leisure by menials remains in vogue as a conventionality which the demands of reputability will not suffer to be slighted.
3570_5695_000001_000007 It is by no means an uncommon spectacle to find a man applying himself to work with the utmost assiduity, in order that his wife may in due form render for him that degree of vicarious leisure which the common sense of the time demands.
3570_5695_000002_000000 The leisure rendered by the wife in such cases is, of course, not a simple manifestation of idleness or indolence.
3570_5695_000002_000001 It almost invariably occurs disguised under some form of work or household duties or social amenities, which prove on analysis to serve little or no ulterior end beyond showing that she does not occupy herself with anything that is gainful or that is of substantial use.
3570_5695_000002_000003 Not that the results of her attention to household matters, of a decorative and mundificatory character, are not pleasing to the sense of men trained in middle class proprieties; but the taste to which these effects of household adornment and tidiness appeal is a taste which has been formed under the selective guidance of a canon of propriety that demands just these evidences of wasted effort.
3570_5695_000002_000004 The effects are pleasing to us chiefly because we have been taught to find them pleasing.
3570_5695_000002_000005 There goes into these domestic duties much solicitude for a proper combination of form and color, and for other ends that are to be classed as aesthetic in the proper sense of the term; and it is not denied that effects having some substantial aesthetic value are sometimes attained.
3570_5695_000002_000006 Pretty much all that is here insisted on is that, as regards these amenities of life, the housewife's efforts are under the guidance of traditions that have been shaped by the law of conspicuously wasteful expenditure of time and substance.
3570_5695_000002_000007 If beauty or comfort is achieved and it is a more or less fortuitous circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economic law of wasted effort.
3570_5695_000002_000008 The more reputable, "presentable" portion of middle class household paraphernalia are, on the one hand, items of conspicuous consumption, and on the other hand, apparatus for putting in evidence the vicarious leisure rendered by the housewife.
3570_5695_000004_000000 This vicarious consumption practiced by the household of the middle and lower classes can not be counted as a direct expression of the leisure class scheme of life, since the household of this pecuniary grade does not belong within the leisure class.
3570_5695_000004_000001 It is rather that the leisure class scheme of life here comes to an expression at the second remove.
3570_5695_000004_000002 The leisure class stands at the head of the social structure in point of reputability; and its manner of life and its standards of worth therefore afford the norm of reputability for the community.
3570_5695_000004_000003 The observance of these standards, in some degree of approximation, becomes incumbent upon all classes lower in the scale.
3570_5695_000004_000006 The basis on which good repute in any highly organized industrial community ultimately rests is pecuniary strength; and the means of showing pecuniary strength, and so of gaining or retaining a good name, are leisure and a conspicuous consumption of goods.
3570_5695_000004_000008 Lower still, where any degree of leisure, even ostensible, has become impracticable for the wife, the conspicuous consumption of goods remains and is carried on by the wife and children.
3570_5695_000004_000009 The man of the household also can do something in this direction, and indeed, he commonly does; but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence-along the margin of the slums-the man, and presently also the children, virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances, and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household's pecuniary decency.
3570_5695_000004_000010 No class of society, not even the most abjectly poor, forgoes all customary conspicuous consumption.
3570_5695_000004_000011 The last items of this category of consumption are not given up except under stress of the direst necessity.
3570_5695_000004_000012 Very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decency is put away.
3570_5695_000004_000013 There is no class and no country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need.
3570_5695_000005_000000 From the foregoing survey of the growth of conspicuous leisure and consumption, it appears that the utility of both alike for the purposes of reputability lies in the element of waste that is common to both. In the one case it is a waste of time and effort, in the other it is a waste of goods.
3570_5695_000005_000001 Both are methods of demonstrating the possession of wealth, and the two are conventionally accepted as equivalents.
3570_5695_000005_000002 The choice between them is a question of advertising expediency simply, except so far as it may be affected by other standards of propriety, springing from a different source.
3570_5695_000005_000003 On grounds of expediency the preference may be given to the one or the other at different stages of the economic development.
3570_5695_000005_000004 The question is, which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect.
3570_5695_000005_000005 Usage has answered this question in different ways under different circumstances.
3570_5695_000006_000001 Each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth.
3570_5695_000006_000003 This is especially true during the later, peaceable economic stage.
3570_5695_000006_000004 The means of communication and the mobility of the population now expose the individual to the observation of many persons who have no other means of judging of his reputability than the display of goods (and perhaps of breeding) which he is able to make while he is under their direct observation.
3570_5695_000007_000001 The exigencies of the modern industrial system frequently place individuals and households in juxtaposition between whom there is little contact in any other sense than that of juxtaposition. One's neighbors, mechanically speaking, often are socially not one's neighbors, or even acquaintances; and still their transient good opinion has a high degree of utility.
3570_5695_000007_000002 The only practicable means of impressing one's pecuniary ability on these unsympathetic observers of one's everyday life is an unremitting demonstration of ability to pay.
3570_5695_000007_000003 In the modern community there is also a more frequent attendance at large gatherings of people to whom one's everyday life is unknown; in such places as churches, theaters, ballrooms, hotels, parks, shops, and the like.
3570_5695_000007_000004 In order to impress these transient observers, and to retain one's self complacency under their observation, the signature of one's pecuniary strength should be written in characters which he who runs may read.
3570_5695_000007_000005 It is evident, therefore, that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure.
3570_5695_000008_000000 It is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute, as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency, is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest.
3570_5695_000008_000002 The result is that, in order to keep up a decent appearance, the former habitually live hand to mouth to a greater extent than the latter.
3570_5695_000008_000003 So it comes, for instance, that the American farmer and his wife and daughters are notoriously less modish in their dress, as well as less urbane in their manners, than the city artisan's family with an equal income.
3570_5695_000008_000004 It is not that the city population is by nature much more eager for the peculiar complacency that comes of a conspicuous consumption, nor has the rural population less regard for pecuniary decency.
3570_5695_000008_000005 But the provocation to this line of evidence, as well as its transient effectiveness, is more decided in the city.
3570_5695_000008_000006 This method is therefore more readily resorted to, and in the struggle to outdo one another the city population push their normal standard of conspicuous consumption to a higher point, with the result that a relatively greater expenditure in this direction is required to indicate a given degree of pecuniary decency in the city.
3570_5695_000008_000007 The requirement of conformity to this higher conventional standard becomes mandatory.
3570_5695_000008_000008 The standard of decency is higher, class for class, and this requirement of decent appearance must be lived up to on pain of losing caste.
3570_5695_000009_000000 Consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country.
3570_5695_000009_000001 Among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of Pecuniary repute.
3570_5695_000009_000002 These home comforts and the leisure indulged in-where the indulgence is found-are of course also in great part to be classed as items of conspicuous consumption; and much the same is to be said of the savings.
3570_5695_000009_000004 Among the latter, everybody's affairs, especially everybody's pecuniary status, are known to everybody else.
3570_5695_000009_000005 Considered by itself simply-taken in the first degree-this added provocation to which the artisan and the urban laboring classes are exposed may not very seriously decrease the amount of savings; but in its cumulative action, through raising the standard of decent expenditure, its deterrent effect on the tendency to save cannot but be very great.
3570_5695_000010_000001 The peculiar habits of the class in this respect are commonly set down to some kind of an ill defined moral deficiency with which this class is credited, or to a morally deleterious influence which their occupation is supposed to exert, in some unascertainable way, upon the men employed in it.
3570_5695_000010_000002 The state of the case for the men who work in the composition and press rooms of the common run of printing houses may be summed up as follows. Skill acquired in any printing house or any city is easily turned to account in almost any other house or city; that is to say, the inertia due to special training is slight.
3570_5695_000010_000004 The inertia due to the home feeling is consequently also slight.
3570_5695_000010_000005 At the same time the wages in the trade are high enough to make movement from place to place relatively easy.
3570_5695_000010_000006 The result is a great mobility of the labor employed in printing; perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable body of workmen.
3570_5695_000010_000007 These men are constantly thrown in contact with new groups of acquaintances, with whom the relations established are transient or ephemeral, but whose good opinion is valued none the less for the time being.
3570_5695_000010_000008 The human proclivity to ostentation, reenforced by sentiments of good fellowship, leads them to spend freely in those directions which will best serve these needs.
3570_5695_000010_000009 Here as elsewhere prescription seizes upon the custom as soon as it gains a vogue, and incorporates it in the accredited standard of decency.
3570_5696_000002_000000 But there are other standards of repute and other, more or less imperative, canons of conduct, besides wealth and its manifestation, and some of these come in to accentuate or to qualify the broad, fundamental canon of conspicuous waste.
3570_5696_000002_000001 Under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising, we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset.
3570_5696_000002_000002 Leisure might then be expected gradually to yield ground and tend to obsolescence as the economic development goes forward, and the community increases in size; while the conspicuous consumption of goods should gradually gain in importance, both absolutely and relatively, until it had absorbed all the available product, leaving nothing over beyond a bare livelihood.
3570_5696_000002_000003 But the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme.
3570_5696_000002_000004 Leisure held the first place at the start, and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods, both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency, during the quasi peaceable culture.
3570_5696_000002_000005 From that point onward, consumption has gained ground, until, at present, it unquestionably holds the primacy, though it is still far from absorbing the entire margin of production above the subsistence minimum.
3570_5696_000003_000000 The early ascendency of leisure as a means of reputability is traceable to the archaic distinction between noble and ignoble employments. Leisure is honorable and becomes imperative partly because it shows exemption from ignoble labor.
3570_5696_000003_000001 The archaic differentiation into noble and ignoble classes is based on an invidious distinction between employments as honorific or debasing; and this traditional distinction grows into an imperative canon of decency during the early quasi peaceable stage. Its ascendency is furthered by the fact that leisure is still fully as effective an evidence of wealth as consumption.
3570_5696_000003_000002 Indeed, so effective is it in the relatively small and stable human environment to which the individual is exposed at that cultural stage, that, with the aid of the archaic tradition which deprecates all productive labor, it gives rise to a large impecunious leisure class, and it even tends to limit the production of the community's industry to the subsistence minimum.
3570_5696_000003_000003 This extreme inhibition of industry is avoided because slave labor, working under a compulsion more vigorous than that of reputability, is forced to turn out a product in excess of the subsistence minimum of the working class.
3570_5696_000003_000004 The subsequent relative decline in the use of conspicuous leisure as a basis of repute is due partly to an increasing relative effectiveness of consumption as an evidence of wealth; but in part it is traceable to another force, alien, and in some degree antagonistic, to the usage of conspicuous waste.
3570_5696_000004_000000 This alien factor is the instinct of workmanship.
3570_5696_000004_000001 Other circumstances permitting, that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use.
3570_5696_000004_000002 It disposes them to deprecate waste of substance or effort.
3570_5696_000004_000003 The instinct of workmanship is present in all men, and asserts itself even under very adverse circumstances.
3570_5696_000004_000004 So that however wasteful a given expenditure may be in reality, it must at least have some colorable excuse in the way of an ostensible purpose.
3570_5696_000004_000006 In so far as it comes into conflict with the law of conspicuous waste, the instinct of workmanship expresses itself not so much in insistence on substantial usefulness as in an abiding sense of the odiousness and aesthetic impossibility of what is obviously futile. Being of the nature of an instinctive affection, its guidance touches chiefly and immediately the obvious and apparent violations of its requirements.
3570_5696_000004_000007 It is only less promptly and with less constraining force that it reaches such substantial violations of its requirements as are appreciated only upon reflection.
3570_5696_000005_000002 All extraneous considerations apart, those persons (adult) are but a vanishing minority today who harbor no inclination to the accomplishment of some end, or who are not impelled of their own motion to shape some object or fact or relation for human use.
3570_5696_000005_000004 But the fact that it may under stress of circumstances eventuate in inanities no more disproves the presence of the instinct than the reality of the brooding instinct is disproved by inducing a hen to sit on a nestful of china eggs.
3570_5696_000006_000000 This latter day uneasy reaching out for some form of purposeful activity that shall at the same time not be indecorously productive of either individual or collective gain marks a difference of attitude between the modern leisure class and that of the quasi peaceable stage.
3570_5696_000006_000004 When the community developed into a peaceful industrial organization, and when fuller occupation of the land had reduced the opportunities for the hunt to an inconsiderable residue, the pressure of energy seeking purposeful employment was left to find an outlet in some other direction.
3570_5696_000006_000005 The ignominy which attaches to useful effort also entered upon a less acute phase with the disappearance of compulsory labor; and the instinct of workmanship then came to assert itself with more persistence and consistency.
3570_5696_000007_000002 But that canon of reputability which discountenances all employment that is of the nature of productive effort is still at hand, and will permit nothing beyond the most transient vogue to any employment that is substantially useful or productive.
3570_5696_000007_000004 A reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make believe.
3570_5696_000007_000006 And along with the make believe of purposeful employment, and woven inextricably into its texture, there is commonly, if not invariably, a more or less appreciable element of purposeful effort directed to some serious end.
3570_5696_000008_000000 In the narrower sphere of vicarious leisure a similar change has gone forward.
3570_5696_000008_000001 Instead of simply passing her time in visible idleness, as in the best days of the patriarchal regime, the housewife of the advanced peaceable stage applies herself assiduously to household cares.
3570_5696_000008_000002 The salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated.
3570_5696_000008_000003 Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods or of services or human life, runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumer's good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities.
3570_5696_000008_000004 In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.
3570_5696_000008_000005 No merit would accrue from the consumption of the bare necessaries of life, except by comparison with the abjectly poor who fall short even of the subsistence minimum; and no standard of expenditure could result from such a comparison, except the most prosaic and unattractive level of decency.
3570_5696_000008_000006 A standard of life would still be possible which should admit of invidious comparison in other respects than that of opulence; as, for instance, a comparison in various directions in the manifestation of moral, physical, intellectual, or aesthetic force.
3570_5696_000009_000000 The use of the term "waste" is in one respect an unfortunate one.
3570_5696_000009_000005 If he chooses it, that disposes of the question of its relative utility to him, as compared with other forms of consumption that would not be deprecated on account of their wastefulness.
3570_5696_000009_000007 As seen from the point of view of the individual consumer, the question of wastefulness does not arise within the scope of economic theory proper.
3570_5696_000009_000008 The use of the word "waste" as a technical term, therefore, implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste.
3570_5696_000010_000001 This common sense implication is itself an outcropping of the instinct of workmanship.
3570_5696_000010_000003 In order to meet with unqualified approval, any economic fact must approve itself under the test of impersonal usefulness-usefulness as seen from the point of view of the generically human.
3570_5696_000011_000003 As items which sometimes fall under this head, and are therefore available as illustrations of the manner in which this principle applies, may be cited carpets and tapestries, silver table service, waiter's services, silk hats, starched linen, many articles of jewelry and of dress.
3570_5696_000011_000005 The test to which all expenditure must be brought in an attempt to decide that point is the question whether it serves directly to enhance human life on the whole whether it furthers the life process taken impersonally.
3570_5696_000011_000006 For this is the basis of award of the instinct of workmanship, and that instinct is the court of final appeal in any question of economic truth or adequacy.
3570_5696_000011_000007 It is a question as to the award rendered by a dispassionate common sense.
3570_5696_000011_000010 Consumable goods, and even productive goods, generally show the two elements in combination, as constituents of their utility; although, in a general way, the element of waste tends to predominate in articles of consumption, while the contrary is true of articles designed for productive use.

3575_170457_000010_000001 How long are we likely to be separated? Why are we to be denied each other's society?
3575_170457_000010_000002 It is an inscrutable fatality.
3575_170457_000010_000004 You first pointed out to me that way in which I am so feebly endeavouring to travel, and now I cannot keep you by my side, I must proceed sorrowfully alone.
3575_170457_000010_000005 Why are we to be divided?
3575_170457_000010_000007 At first, I could not say 'Thy will be done!' I felt rebellious, but I knew it was wrong to feel so.

3575_170457_000012_000003 He spoke French perfectly, I have been told, when need was; but delighted usually in talking the broadest Yorkshire.
3575_170457_000012_000007 And so life and death have dispersed the circle of "violent Radicals and Dissenters" into which, twenty years ago, the little, quiet, resolute clergyman's daughter was received, and by whom she was truly loved and honoured.
3575_170457_000015_000003 Whoever, therefore, is ambitious of distinction in this way ought to be prepared for disappointment.
3575_170457_000016_000000 "But it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent, if you consult your own happiness.
3575_170457_000016_000004 The day dreams in which you habitually indulge are likely to induce a distempered state of mind; and in proportion as all the ordinary uses of the world seem to you flat and unprofitable, you will be unfitted for them without becoming fitted for anything else.

3575_170457_000017_000001 I only exhort you so to think of it, and so to use it, as to render it conducive to your own permanent good.

3575_170457_000037_000002 On august twenty seventh eighteen thirty seven, she writes:--
3575_170457_000040_000004 And, meantime, I know the greatness of Jehovah; I acknowledge the perfection of His word; I adore the purity of the Christian faith; my theory is right, my practice horribly wrong."
3575_170457_000041_000003 The former from reserve, the latter from timidity, avoided all friendships and intimacies beyond their family. Emily was impervious to influence; she never came in contact with public opinion, and her own decision of what was right and fitting was a law for her conduct and appearance, with which she allowed no one to interfere. Her love was poured out on Anne, as Charlotte's was on her.
3575_170457_000044_000011 I am not good enough for you, and you must be kept from the contamination of too intimate society.
3575_170457_000044_000014 Papa says he highly approves of my friendship with you, and he wishes me to continue it through life."
3575_170457_000046_000001 He refused at first to listen to the careful advice; it was repugnant to his liberal nature.
3575_170457_000046_000002 But Miss Branwell persevered; urged economical motives; pressed on his love for his daughters.

367_130732_000000_000000 Lobsters and Lobsters
367_130732_000001_000000 When is a lobster not a lobster?
367_130732_000001_000001 When it is a crayfish.
367_130732_000001_000002 This question and answer might well go into the primer of information for those who come to San Francisco from the East, for what is called a lobster in San Francisco is not a lobster at all but a crayfish.
367_130732_000002_000000 Lobster, served cold with mayonnaise, or broiled live lobster are most frequently called for, and while they are both excellent, we find so many other ways of preparing this crustacean that we rarely take the common variety of lobster dishes into consideration.
367_130732_000002_000001 Probably nowhere in San Francisco could one get lobster better served than in the Old Delmonico restaurant of the days before the fire.
367_130732_000002_000002 A book could be written about this restaurant and then all would not be told for all its secrets can never be known.
367_130732_000003_000000 In New York City they have what they are pleased to call "Lobster Palaces," but there is not a restaurant in that great metropolis that could approach the Delmonico of San Francisco in its splendid service and its cuisine arrangements; neither could they approach the romance that always surrounded the O'Farrell street restaurant.
367_130732_000003_000001 It was here that most magnificent dinners were arranged; it was here that extraordinary dishes were concocted by chefs of world-wide fame; it was here that Lobster a la Newberg reached its highest perfection, and this is the recipe that was followed when it was prepared in the Delmonico:
367_130732_000005_000004 Put this in a double boiler and let cook until thick, stirring constantly.
367_130732_000005_000005 When this is cooked pour it over the lobster and let all cook together for three minutes.
367_130732_000005_000006 Serve in a chafing dish with thin slices of dry toast.
367_130732_000006_000000 King of Shell Fish
367_130732_000007_000000 One has to come to San Francisco to partake of the king of shell fish- the mammoth Pacific crab.
367_130732_000007_000001 I say "come to San Francisco" advisedly, for while the crab is found all along the coast it is prepared nowhere so deliciously as in San Francisco.
367_130732_000008_000001 Gobey ran one of those places which was not in good repute, consequently when ladies went there they were usually veiled and slipped in through an alley, but the enticement of Gobey's crab stew was too much for conventionality and his little private rooms were always full.
367_130732_000009_000000 Gobey's passed with the fire, and the little restaurant bearing his name, and in charge of his widow, in Union Square avenue, has not attained the fame of the old place.
367_130732_000009_000001 It is possible that she knows the secret of preparing crab as it was prepared in the Gobey's of before the fire, but his prestige did not descend to her.
367_130732_000010_000001 It is as follows:
367_130732_000011_000000 Gobey's Crab Stew
367_130732_000012_000002 Soak the crab meat in the sherry two hours before cooking.
367_130732_000012_000003 Chop fine the onion, sweet pepper and tomato with the rosemary.
367_130732_000012_000005 Heat this in a stewpan and when simmering add the sherry and crab meat and let all cook together with a slow fire for eight minutes.
367_130732_000012_000006 Serve in a chafing dish with toasted crackers or thin slices of toasted bread.
367_130732_000012_000007 A dash of Worcestershire sauce just before it is taken up adds to the flavor.
367_130732_000013_000000 Lobster in Miniature
367_130732_000015_000002 This is the recipe for eight people, and it is well worth trying if you are giving a dinner of importance:
367_130732_000016_000000 Bisque of Crawfish
367_130732_000017_000000 Take thirty crawfish, from which remove the gut containing the gall in the following manner: Take firm hold of the crawfish with the left hand so as to avoid being pinched by its claws; with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand pinch the extreme end of the central fin of the tail, and, with a sudden jerk, the gut will be withdrawn.
367_130732_000018_000001 Put these ingredients into a stewpan and fry them ten minutes, then throw in the crawfish and pour on them half a bottle of French white wine.
367_130732_000018_000002 Allow this to boil and then add a quart of strong consomme and let all continue boiling for half an hour.
367_130732_000018_000003 Pick out the crawfish and strain the broth through a napkin by pressure into a basin in order to extract all the essence from the vegetables.
367_130732_000019_000001 Reserve some of the spawn, also half of the body shells with which to make the crawfish butter to finish the soup.
367_130732_000019_000002 This butter is made as follows: Place the shells on a baking sheet in the oven to dry; let the shells cool and then pound them in a mortar with a little lobster coral and four ounces of fresh butter, thoroughly bruising the whole together so as to make a fine paste.
367_130732_000019_000003 Put this in a stewpan and set it over a slow fire to simmer for about five minutes, then rub it through a sieve with considerable pressure into a basin containing ice water.
367_130732_000020_000000 Reverting to the original recipe: Take the remainder of the crawfish and add thereto three anchovies, washed for the purpose, and also the crusts of French rolls, fried to a light brown color in butter.
367_130732_000020_000001 Pound all these thoroughly together and then put them into a stewpan with the broth that has been reserved in a basin, and having warmed the bisque thus prepared rub it through a sieve into a fine puree.
367_130732_000020_000002 Put this puree into a soup pot and finish by incorporating therewith the crawfish butter and season with a little cayenne pepper and the juice of half a lemon.
367_130732_000020_000003 Pour the bisque quite hot into the tureen in which have been placed the crawfish tails, and send to the table.

367_293981_000002_000000 IN WHICH ARE CONTAINED THE INNUMERABLE TROUBLES WHICH THE BRAVE DON QUIXOTE AND HIS GOOD SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA ENDURED IN THE INN, WHICH TO HIS MISFORTUNE HE TOOK TO BE A CASTLE
367_293981_000004_000000 "How can I sleep, curses on it!" returned Sancho discontentedly and bitterly, "when it is plain that all the devils have been at me this night?"
367_293981_000005_000000 "Thou mayest well believe that," answered Don Quixote, "because, either I know little, or this castle is enchanted, for thou must know but this that I am now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret until after my death."
367_293981_000007_000000 "I say so," continued Don Quixote, "because I hate taking away anyone's good name."
367_293981_000008_000000 "I say," replied Sancho, "that I swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship's days, and God grant I may be able to let it out tomorrow."
367_293981_000010_000000 "It is not for that," replied Sancho, "but because I hate keeping things long, and I don't want them to grow rotten with me from over keeping."
367_293981_000014_000000 "Didn't I say so? worse luck to my line!" said Sancho.
367_293981_000021_000000 "I would speak more politely if I were you," replied Don Quixote; "is it the way of this country to address knights errant in that style, you booby?"
367_293981_000027_000000 Sancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous, begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, which was no small quantity.
367_293981_000030_000002 This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at the end of which he was left, not like his master, but so weak and exhausted that he could not stand.
367_293981_000033_000000 "Then this is an inn?" said Don Quixote.
367_293981_000034_000000 "And a very respectable one," said the innkeeper.
367_293981_000040_000000 The cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his master, who, halting to listen attentively, was persuaded that some new adventure was coming, until he clearly perceived that it was his squire who uttered them.
3729_6852_000003_000001 Baletti's father, who had just recovered from a long illness, was not with us, but we had his father's sister, who was older than Mario.
3729_6852_000003_000004 Martelli composed a satire against Maffei, in which he designated him by the anagram of Femia.
3729_6852_000004_000003 In order to please her, I spoke to her of the Abbe Conti, and I had occasion to quote two lines of that profound writer.
3729_6852_000008_000001 She held her tongue, but from that time she told everybody that I was an impostor.
3729_6852_000026_000000 "Well!
3729_6852_000026_000001 I shall call you Esprit."
3729_6852_000028_000000 "Here, go and get me change for a Louis."
3729_6852_000029_000000 "I have it, sir."
3729_6852_000035_000001 After his visit I told Esprit to take me to the Palais Royal, and I left him at the gates.
3729_6852_000037_000000 "Excellent, I made it myself yesterday."
3729_6852_000039_000000 "The milk is very good."
3729_6852_000040_000000 "Milk!
3729_6852_000040_000001 I never drink any.
3729_6852_000040_000002 Make me a cup of fresh coffee without milk."
3729_6852_000041_000000 "Without milk!
3729_6852_000041_000001 Well, sir, we never make coffee but in the afternoon. Would you like a good bavaroise, or a decanter of orgeat?"
3729_6852_000042_000000 "Yes, give me the orgeat."
3729_6852_000044_000000 "You are mad, she has given birth to a princess."
3729_6852_000048_000001 I address him in Italian, and he answers very wittily, but his way of speaking makes me smile, and I tell him why.
3729_6852_000048_000003 My remark pleases him, but I soon prove to him that it is not the right way to speak, however perfect may have been the language of that ancient writer.
3729_6852_000049_000000 My new friend was a poet as I was; he was an admirer of Italian literature, while I admired the French.
3729_6852_000055_000000 I laugh heartily.
3729_6852_000066_000001 The 'badauds', who never fail to congregate near the carriage of princes, no matter if they have seen them a hundred times, or if they know them to be as ugly as monkeys, repeated the words of the duchess everywhere, and that was enough to send here all the snuff takers of the capital in a hurry.
3729_6852_000068_000000 "Quite the reverse, for it was a cunning artifice on her part.
3729_6852_000068_000004 Therefore it is not a paradox to say that the French would be wiser if they were less witty.
3729_6852_000078_000003 I thanked him, but I was not deceived by his compliment.
3729_6852_000081_000001 But, sir, how shall I find a teacher?
3729_6852_000082_000002 I have the best Italian poets.
3729_6852_000084_000003 The expression of Crebillon's face was that of the lion's or of the cat's, which is the same thing.
3764_168670_000001_000000 "And she will hold her tongue?"
3764_168670_000002_000000 "I answer for that."
3764_168670_000003_000000 "But you, Father Madeleine?"
3764_168670_000004_000000 And, after a silence, fraught with anxiety, Fauchelevent exclaimed:--
3764_168670_000005_000000 "Why, get out as you came in!"
3764_168670_000006_000000 Jean Valjean, as in the first instance, contented himself with saying, "Impossible."
3764_168670_000007_000000 Fauchelevent grumbled, more to himself than to Jean Valjean:--
3764_168670_000008_000000 "There is another thing which bothers me.
3764_168670_000008_000001 I have said that I would put earth in it.
3764_168670_000008_000002 When I come to think it over, the earth instead of the corpse will not seem like the real thing, it won't do, it will get displaced, it will move about.
3764_168670_000008_000003 The men will bear it.
3764_168670_000008_000004 You understand, Father Madeleine, the government will notice it."
3764_168670_000009_000000 Jean Valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving.
3764_168670_000010_000000 Fauchelevent went on:--
3764_168670_000011_000003 The prioress expects you."
3764_168670_000012_000000 Then he explained to Jean Valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he, Fauchelevent, was to render to the community.
3764_168670_000012_000002 That the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed, and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel.
3764_168670_000012_000004 That the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased.
3764_168670_000012_000005 That it was so much the worse for the government.
3764_168670_000012_000006 That he, Fauchelevent, was to nail up the coffin in the cell, raise the stone in the chapel, and lower the corpse into the vault.
3764_168670_000012_000008 That the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening, after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery.
3764_168670_000012_000010 And then, that there was another: the empty coffin.
3764_168670_000013_000000 "What is that empty coffin?" asked Jean Valjean.
3764_168670_000015_000000 "The coffin of the administration."
3764_168670_000016_000000 "What coffin?
3764_168670_000016_000001 What administration?"
3764_168670_000017_000000 "A nun dies.
3764_168670_000017_000001 The municipal doctor comes and says, 'A nun has died.' The government sends a coffin.
3764_168670_000017_000002 The next day it sends a hearse and undertaker's men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery.
3764_168670_000018_000000 "Put something in it."
3764_168670_000019_000001 I have none."
3764_168670_000020_000000 "no"
3764_168670_000021_000000 "What then?"
3764_168670_000022_000000 "A living person."
3764_168670_000023_000000 "What person?"
3764_168670_000024_000000 "Me!" said Jean Valjean.
3764_168670_000025_000000 Fauchelevent, who was seated, sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair.
3764_168670_000026_000000 "You!"
3764_168670_000027_000000 "Why not?"
3764_168670_000030_000000 "Ah! good, you can laugh, you are not speaking seriously."
3764_168670_000031_000000 "Very seriously, I must get out of this place."
3764_168670_000034_000000 "Well?"
3764_168670_000035_000000 "The basket will be of pine, and the cover a black cloth."
3764_168670_000036_000000 "In the first place, it will be a white cloth.
3764_168670_000036_000001 Nuns are buried in white."
3764_168670_000037_000000 "Let it be a white cloth, then."
3764_168670_000038_000000 "You are not like other men, Father Madeleine."
3764_168670_000041_000000 "The problem is to get out of here without being seen.
3764_168670_000041_000001 This offers the means.
3764_168670_000041_000003 How is it managed?
3764_168670_000041_000004 Where is this coffin?"
3764_168670_000042_000000 "The empty one?"
3764_168670_000043_000000 "Yes."
3764_168670_000044_000001 It stands on two trestles, under the pall."
3764_168670_000045_000000 "How long is the coffin?"
3764_168670_000046_000000 "Six feet."
3764_168670_000047_000000 "What is this dead room?"
3764_168670_000048_000000 "It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden, which is closed on the outside by a shutter, and two doors; one leads into the convent, the other into the church."
3764_168670_000049_000000 "What church?"
3764_168670_000050_000000 "The church in the street, the church which any one can enter."
3764_168670_000051_000000 "Have you the keys to those two doors?"
3764_168670_000052_000000 "No; I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent; the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church."
3764_168670_000053_000000 "When does the porter open that door?"
3764_168670_000054_000000 "Only to allow the undertaker's men to enter, when they come to get the coffin.
3764_168670_000054_000001 When the coffin has been taken out, the door is closed again."
3764_168670_000055_000000 "Who nails up the coffin?"
3764_168670_000056_000000 "I do."
3764_168670_000057_000000 "Who spreads the pall over it?"
3764_168670_000058_000000 "I do."
3764_168670_000059_000000 "Are you alone?"
3764_168670_000060_000000 "Not another man, except the police doctor, can enter the dead room. That is even written on the wall."
3764_168670_000061_000000 "Could you hide me in that room to night when every one is asleep?"
3764_168670_000062_000000 "no
3764_168670_000064_000000 "About three o'clock in the afternoon.
3764_168670_000064_000001 The burial will take place at the Vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall.
3764_168670_000064_000002 It is not very near."
3764_168670_000065_000001 And how about food?
3764_168670_000065_000002 I shall be hungry."
3764_168670_000067_000000 "You can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock."
3764_168670_000069_000000 "But that is impossible!"
3764_168670_000070_000001 Impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank?"
3764_168670_000071_000000 What seemed unprecedented to Fauchelevent was, we repeat, a simple matter to Jean Valjean.
3764_168670_000071_000002 Any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape.
3764_168670_000071_000003 The prisoner is subject to flight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him. An escape is a cure.
3764_168670_000071_000004 What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure?
3764_168670_000071_000005 To have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods, to live for a long time in a box, to find air where there is none, to economize his breath for hours, to know how to stifle without dying-this was one of Jean Valjean's gloomy talents.
3764_168670_000072_000000 Moreover, a coffin containing a living being,--that convict's expedient,--is also an imperial expedient.
3764_168670_000072_000001 If we are to credit the monk Austin Castillejo, this was the means employed by Charles the Fifth, desirous of seeing the Plombes for the last time after his abdication.
3764_168670_000075_000000 "But how will you manage to breathe?"
3764_168670_000076_000000 "I will breathe."
3764_168670_000077_000000 "In that box!
3764_168670_000077_000001 The mere thought of it suffocates me."
3764_168670_000078_000000 "You surely must have a gimlet, you will make a few holes here and there, around my mouth, and you will nail the top plank on loosely."
3764_168670_000079_000000 "Good!
3764_168670_000080_000000 "A man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze."
3764_168670_000081_000000 And Jean Valjean added:--
3764_168670_000082_000000 "Father Fauchelevent, we must come to a decision: I must either be caught here, or accept this escape through the hearse."
3764_168670_000083_000000 Every one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and lounging between the two leaves of a half shut door.
3764_168670_000083_000001 Who is there who has not said to a cat, "Do come in!" There are men who, when an incident stands half open before them, have the same tendency to halt in indecision between two resolutions, at the risk of getting crushed through the abrupt closing of the adventure by fate.
3764_168670_000083_000002 The over prudent, cats as they are, and because they are cats, sometimes incur more danger than the audacious.
3764_168670_000083_000003 Fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature.
3764_168670_000083_000004 But Jean Valjean's coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself.
3764_168670_000083_000005 He grumbled:--
3764_168670_000084_000000 "Well, since there is no other means."
3764_168670_000085_000000 Jean Valjean resumed:--
3764_168670_000086_000000 "The only thing which troubles me is what will take place at the cemetery."
3764_168670_000087_000001 "If you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right, I am sure of getting you out of the grave.
3764_168670_000087_000002 The grave digger is a drunkard, and a friend of mine.
3764_168670_000087_000003 He is Father Mestienne.
3764_168670_000087_000004 An old fellow of the old school.
3764_168670_000087_000005 The grave digger puts the corpses in the grave, and I put the grave digger in my pocket.
3764_168670_000087_000006 I will tell you what will take place.
3764_168670_000087_000007 They will arrive a little before dusk, three quarters of an hour before the gates of the cemetery are closed.
3764_168670_000087_000008 The hearse will drive directly up to the grave.
3764_168670_000087_000009 I shall follow; that is my business.
3764_168670_000087_000010 I shall have a hammer, a chisel, and some pincers in my pocket.
3764_168670_000087_000011 The hearse halts, the undertaker's men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down.
3764_168670_000087_000012 The priest says the prayers, makes the sign of the cross, sprinkles the holy water, and takes his departure.
3764_168670_000087_000013 I am left alone with Father Mestienne. He is my friend, I tell you.
3764_168670_000087_000014 One of two things will happen, he will either be sober, or he will not be sober.
3764_168670_000087_000016 Then you have no longer any one but me to deal with.
3764_168671_000002_000000 CHAPTER five-IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BE DRUNK IN ORDER TO BE IMMORTAL
3764_168671_000003_000001 This hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross, like a huge corpse with drooping arms.
3764_168671_000003_000002 A mourning coach, in which could be seen a priest in his surplice, and a choir boy in his red cap, followed.
3764_168671_000003_000004 Behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer, who limped along.
3764_168671_000003_000005 The procession was going in the direction of the Vaugirard cemetery.
3764_168671_000004_000000 The handle of a hammer, the blade of a cold chisel, and the antennae of a pair of pincers were visible, protruding from the man's pocket.
3764_168671_000005_000000 The Vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of Paris.
3764_168671_000005_000002 The grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter, in this cemetery, they were subjected to a special discipline.
3764_168671_000005_000003 The gates of the Paris cemeteries closed, at that epoch, at sundown, and this being a municipal regulation, the Vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like the rest.
3764_168671_000005_000006 If any grave digger were delayed after that moment in the cemetery, there was but one way for him to get out-his grave digger's card furnished by the department of public funerals.
3764_168671_000005_000007 A sort of letter box was constructed in the porter's window. The grave digger dropped his card into this box, the porter heard it fall, pulled the rope, and the small door opened.
3764_168671_000005_000008 If the man had not his card, he mentioned his name, the porter, who was sometimes in bed and asleep, rose, came out and identified the man, and opened the gate with his key; the grave digger stepped out, but had to pay a fine of fifteen francs.
3764_168671_000006_000000 This cemetery, with its peculiarities outside the regulations, embarrassed the symmetry of the administration.
3764_168671_000006_000001 It was suppressed a little later than eighteen thirty.
3764_168671_000007_000000 The Vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery.
3764_168671_000007_000002 Dampness was invading it, the flowers were deserting it.
3764_168671_000007_000003 The bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the Vaugirard; it hinted at poverty.
3764_168671_000007_000005 The Vaugirard cemetery was a venerable enclosure, planted like an old-fashioned French garden.
3764_168671_000007_000006 Straight alleys, box, thuya trees, holly, ancient tombs beneath aged cypress trees, and very tall grass.
3764_168671_000007_000007 In the evening it was tragic there.
3764_168671_000008_000000 The sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the black cross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery.
3764_168671_000008_000001 The lame man who followed it was no other than Fauchelevent.
3764_168671_000010_000000 Let us remark in passing, that the burial of Mother Crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight.
3764_168671_000010_000001 It is one of the faults which resemble a duty.
3764_168671_000010_000002 The nuns had committed it, not only without difficulty, but even with the applause of their own consciences.
3764_168671_000010_000003 In the cloister, what is called the "government" is only an intermeddling with authority, an interference which is always questionable.
3764_168671_000010_000004 In the first place, the rule; as for the code, we shall see.
3764_168671_000010_000005 Make as many laws as you please, men; but keep them for yourselves. The tribute to Caesar is never anything but the remnants of the tribute to God.
3764_168671_000012_000000 What remained to be done was a mere nothing.
3764_168671_000012_000001 Within the last two years, he had made good Father Mestienne, a chubby cheeked person, drunk at least ten times.
3764_168671_000012_000002 He played with Father Mestienne.
3764_168671_000012_000003 He did what he liked with him.
3764_168671_000012_000004 He made him dance according to his whim.
3764_168671_000012_000005 Mestienne's head adjusted itself to the cap of Fauchelevent's will.
3764_168671_000012_000006 Fauchelevent's confidence was perfect.
3764_168671_000013_000000 At the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cemetery, Fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse, and said half aloud, as he rubbed his big hands:--
3764_168671_000014_000000 "Here's a fine farce!"
3764_168671_000015_000000 All at once the hearse halted; it had reached the gate.
3764_168671_000015_000001 The permission for interment must be exhibited.
3764_168671_000015_000002 The undertaker's man addressed himself to the porter of the cemetery.
3764_168671_000015_000003 During this colloquy, which always is productive of a delay of from one to two minutes, some one, a stranger, came and placed himself behind the hearse, beside Fauchelevent.
3764_168671_000015_000004 He was a sort of laboring man, who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm.
3764_168671_000018_000000 "The man replied:--
3764_168671_000019_000000 "The grave digger."
3764_168671_000020_000000 If a man could survive the blow of a cannon ball full in the breast, he would make the same face that Fauchelevent made.
3764_168671_000021_000000 "The grave digger?"
3764_168671_000022_000000 "Yes."
3764_168671_000023_000000 "You?"
3764_168671_000024_000000 "I."
3764_168671_000025_000000 "Father Mestienne is the grave digger."
3764_168671_000026_000000 "He was."
3764_168671_000027_000000 "What!
3764_168671_000027_000001 He was?"
3764_168671_000028_000000 "He is dead."
3764_168671_000029_000001 It is true, nevertheless, that grave diggers do die themselves.
3764_168671_000029_000002 By dint of excavating graves for other people, one hollows out one's own.
3764_168671_000030_000001 He had hardly the strength to stammer:--
3764_168671_000032_000000 "It is so."
3764_168671_000033_000000 "But," he persisted feebly, "Father Mestienne is the grave digger."
3764_168671_000034_000000 "After Napoleon, Louis the eighteenth.
3764_168671_000034_000001 After Mestienne, Gribier.
3764_168671_000034_000002 Peasant, my name is Gribier."
3764_168671_000036_000000 He was a tall, thin, livid, utterly funereal man.
3764_168671_000036_000001 He had the air of an unsuccessful doctor who had turned grave digger.
3764_168671_000037_000000 Fauchelevent burst out laughing.
3764_168671_000038_000000 "Ah!" said he, "what queer things do happen!
3764_168671_000038_000001 Father Mestienne is dead, but long live little Father Lenoir!
3764_168671_000038_000002 Do you know who little Father Lenoir is?
3764_168671_000038_000003 He is a jug of red wine.
3764_168671_000038_000005 Ah!
3764_168671_000038_000007 I am sorry for it; he was a jolly fellow.
3764_168671_000038_000008 But you are a jolly fellow, too.
3764_168671_000039_000000 The man replied:--
3764_168671_000040_000000 "I have been a student.
3764_168671_000040_000001 I passed my fourth examination.
3764_168671_000040_000002 I never drink."
3764_168671_000041_000000 The hearse had set out again, and was rolling up the grand alley of the cemetery.
3764_168671_000042_000000 Fauchelevent had slackened his pace.
3764_168671_000042_000001 He limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity.
3764_168671_000043_000000 The grave digger walked on in front of him.
3764_168671_000045_000000 He was one of those men who, though very young, have the air of age, and who, though slender, are extremely strong.
3764_168671_000046_000000 "Comrade!" cried Fauchelevent.
3764_168671_000047_000000 The man turned round.
3764_168671_000048_000000 "I am the convent grave digger."
3764_168671_000050_000001 He muttered:
3764_168671_000052_000000 The man replied:--
3764_168671_000053_000000 "Completely.
3764_168671_000053_000001 The good God consulted his note book which shows when the time is up.
3764_168671_000053_000002 It was Father Mestienne's turn.
3764_168671_000053_000003 Father Mestienne died."
3764_168671_000055_000000 "The good God," said the man authoritatively.
3764_168671_000055_000001 "According to the philosophers, the Eternal Father; according to the Jacobins, the Supreme Being."
3764_168671_000056_000000 "Shall we not make each other's acquaintance?" stammered Fauchelevent.
3764_168671_000057_000000 "It is made.
3764_168671_000058_000001 He who empties his glass empties his heart.
3764_168671_000058_000003 Such a thing cannot be refused."
3764_168671_000059_000000 "Business first."
3764_168671_000061_000000 They were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nuns' corner.
3764_168671_000062_000000 The grave digger resumed:--
3764_168671_000063_000000 "Peasant, I have seven small children who must be fed.
3764_168671_000063_000001 As they must eat, I cannot drink."
3764_168671_000064_000000 And he added, with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well:--
3764_168671_000065_000000 "Their hunger is the enemy of my thirst."
3764_168671_000066_000000 The hearse skirted a clump of cypress trees, quitted the grand alley, turned into a narrow one, entered the waste land, and plunged into a thicket.
3764_168671_000066_000001 This indicated the immediate proximity of the place of sepulture.
3764_168671_000066_000003 Fortunately, the soil, which was light and wet with the winter rains, clogged the wheels and retarded its speed.
3764_168671_000067_000000 He approached the grave digger.
3764_168671_000069_000000 "Villager," retorted the man, "I ought not be a grave digger.
3764_168671_000069_000002 He destined me for literature.
3764_168671_000069_000003 But he had reverses.
3764_168671_000069_000004 He had losses on 'change.
3764_168671_000069_000005 I was obliged to renounce the profession of author.
3997_180294_000002_000000 Chapter twelve
3997_180294_000003_000001 The duke comes every morning; they will tell him, when he comes, that I am asleep, and perhaps he will wait until I wake."
3997_180294_000005_000000 "Listen," she said; "take the little gilt key on the mantelpiece, open that door; bring me back the key and go.
3997_180294_000006_000000 "Yes; but if I should already ask for something?"
3997_180294_000007_000000 "What?"
3997_180294_000008_000000 "Let me have that key."
3997_180294_000010_000000 "Well, do it for me, for I swear to you that I don't love you as the others have loved you."
3997_180294_000011_000000 "Well, keep it; but it only depends on me to make it useless to you, after all."
3997_180294_000012_000000 "How?"
3997_180294_000013_000000 "There are bolts on the door."
3997_180294_000014_000000 "Wretch!"
3997_180294_000015_000000 "I will have them taken off."
3997_180294_000016_000000 "You love, then, a little?"
3997_180294_000017_000001 Now, go; I can't keep my eyes open."
3997_180294_000020_000000 To be loved by a pure young girl, to be the first to reveal to her the strange mystery of love, is indeed a great happiness, but it is the simplest thing in the world.
3997_180294_000021_000001 See how young girls are watched and guarded!
3997_180294_000022_000000 But to be really loved by a courtesan: that is a victory of infinitely greater difficulty.
3997_180294_000022_000001 With them the body has worn out the soul, the senses have burned up the heart, dissipation has blunted the feelings.
3997_180294_000022_000003 They love by profession, and not by instinct.
3997_180294_000023_000000 Then, when God allows love to a courtesan, that love, which at first seems like a pardon, becomes for her almost without penitence.
3997_180294_000023_000002 How strong he feels with his cruel right to say: You do no more for love than you have done for money. They know not what proof to give.
3997_180294_000024_000000 Hence those great devotions, those austere retreats from the world, of which some of them have given an example.
3997_180294_000025_000000 But when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough in soul to receive it without remembering the past, when he gives himself up to it, when, in short, he loves as he is loved, this man drains at one draught all earthly emotions, and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other.
3997_180294_000026_000000 I did not make these reflections on the morning when I returned home. They could but have been the presentiment of what was to happen to me, and, despite my love for Marguerite, I did not foresee such consequences.
3997_180294_000026_000001 I make these reflections to day.
3997_180294_000026_000002 Now that all is irrevocably ended, they a rise naturally out of what has taken place.
3997_180294_000027_000000 But to return to the first day of my liaison.
3997_180294_000027_000001 When I reached home I was in a state of mad gaiety.
3997_180294_000028_000000 One day a young man is passing in the street, he brushes against a woman, looks at her, turns, goes on his way.
3997_180294_000028_000001 He does not know the woman, and she has pleasures, griefs, loves, in which he has no part.
3997_180294_000028_000003 Weeks, months, years pass, and all at once, when they have each followed their fate along a different path, the logic of chance brings them face to face.
3997_180294_000028_000004 The woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him.
3997_180294_000028_000005 How? why?
3997_180294_000028_000006 Their two existences are henceforth one; they have scarcely begun to know one another when it seems as if they had known one another always, and all that had gone before is wiped out from the memory of the two lovers.
3997_180294_000028_000007 It is curious, one must admit.
3997_180294_000029_000000 As for me, I no longer remembered how I had lived before that night. My whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night.
3997_180294_000029_000001 Either Marguerite was very clever in deception, or she had conceived for me one of those sudden passions which are revealed in the first kiss, and which die, often enough, as suddenly as they were born.
3997_180294_000032_000000 "Here are my orders: To night at the Vaudeville.
3997_180294_000036_000000 At seven o'clock I was at the Vaudeville.
3997_180294_000036_000001 Never had I gone to a theatre so early.
3997_180294_000036_000002 The boxes filled one after another.
3997_180294_000036_000003 Only one remained empty, the stage box.
3997_180294_000036_000005 She came to the front at once, looked around the stalls, saw me, and thanked me with a look.
3997_180294_000037_000000 That night she was marvellously beautiful.
3997_180294_000037_000001 Was I the cause of this coquetry?
3997_180294_000039_000000 People blame those who let themselves be ruined by actresses and kept women; what astonishes me is that twenty times greater follies are not committed for them.
3997_180294_000040_000001 As I saw him, a cold shiver went through my heart.
3997_180294_000041_000000 Doubtless Marguerite perceived the impression made on me by the presence of this man, for she smiled to me again, and, turning her back to the count, appeared to be very attentive to the play.
3997_180294_000042_000000 "Good evening," she said as I entered, holding out her hand.
3997_180294_000043_000000 "Good evening," I replied to both Marguerite and Prudence.
3997_180294_000044_000000 "Sit down."
3997_180294_000046_000000 "Yes; I sent him to fetch some sweets, so that we could talk by ourselves for a moment.
3997_180294_000047_000000 "Yes, my children," said she; "have no fear.
3997_180294_000047_000001 I shall say nothing."
3997_180294_000048_000000 "What is the matter with you to night?" said Marguerite, rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead.
3997_180294_000050_000000 "You should go to bed," she replied, with that ironical air which went so well with her delicate and witty face.
3997_180294_000051_000000 "Where?"
3997_180294_000052_000000 "At home."
3997_180294_000053_000000 "You know that I shouldn't be able to sleep there."
3997_180294_000055_000000 "It is not for that reason."
3997_180294_000056_000000 "Yes, it is.
3997_180294_000056_000001 I know; and you are wrong, so let us say no more about it.
3997_180294_000056_000003 Do you understand?"
3997_180294_000057_000000 "Yes."
3997_180294_000058_000000 How could I disobey?
3997_180294_000060_000000 "Can you ask?"
3997_180294_000062_000000 "All day long."
3997_180294_000063_000000 "Do you know that I am really afraid that I shall get very fond of you? Ask Prudence."
3997_180294_000065_000000 "Now, you must go back to your seat.
3997_180294_000065_000001 The count will be coming back, and there is nothing to be gained by his finding you here."
3997_180294_000066_000000 "Because you don't like seeing him."
3997_180294_000068_000000 "Unfortunately, he got it for me without my asking him, and he asked me to go with him; you know well enough that I couldn't refuse.
3997_180294_000069_000000 "I was wrong; forgive me."
3997_180294_000070_000000 "Well and good; and now go back nicely to your place, and, above all, no more jealousy."
3997_180294_000071_000000 She kissed me again, and I left the box.
3997_180294_000071_000002 I returned to my seat.
3997_180294_000072_000000 After all, the presence of m de g in Marguerite's box was the most natural thing in the world.
3997_180297_000000_000000 It was hardly an hour after Joseph and I had begun preparing for my departure, when there was a violent ring at the door.
3997_180297_000002_000000 "Go," I said, asking myself who it could be at such an hour, and not daring to believe that it was Marguerite.
3997_180297_000003_000000 "Sir," said Joseph coming back to me, "it is two ladies."
3997_180297_000004_000000 "It is we, Armand," cried a voice that I recognised as that of Prudence.
3997_180297_000005_000000 I came out of my room.
3997_180297_000005_000001 Prudence was standing looking around the place; Marguerite, seated on the sofa, was meditating.
3997_180297_000006_000000 She kissed me on the forehead, and said:
3997_180297_000007_000000 "This is the third time that I have forgiven you."
3997_180297_000009_000000 "How can my visit change your plans?
3997_180297_000009_000001 I have not come to hinder you from leaving Paris.
3997_180297_000009_000002 I have come because I had no time to answer you during the day, and I did not wish to let you think that I was angry with you. Prudence didn't want me to come; she said that I might be in the way."
3997_180297_000010_000000 "You in the way, Marguerite!
3997_180297_000010_000001 But how?"
3997_180297_000012_000000 During this remark Marguerite looked at me attentively.
3997_180297_000013_000000 "My dear Prudence," I answered, "you do not know what you are saying."
3997_180297_000014_000000 "What a nice place you've got!" Prudence went on.
3997_180297_000014_000001 "May we see the bedroom?"
3997_180297_000015_000000 "Yes."
3997_180297_000017_000000 "Why did you bring Prudence?" I asked her.
3997_180297_000018_000000 "Because she was at the theatre with me, and because when I leave here I want to have some one to see me home."
3997_180297_000019_000000 "Could not I do?"
3997_180297_000020_000000 "Yes, but, besides not wishing to put you out, I was sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up, and as I could not let you, I did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying 'no'"
3997_180297_000021_000000 "And why could you not let me come up?"
3997_180297_000023_000000 "Is that really the only reason?"
3997_180297_000024_000000 "If there were any other, I would tell you; for we are not to have any secrets from one another now."
3997_180297_000025_000001 Honestly, do you care for me a little?"
3997_180297_000026_000000 "A great deal."
3997_180297_000027_000000 "Then why did you deceive me?"
3997_180297_000028_000002 Your question becomes unnecessary and my answer useless."
3997_180297_000030_000001 Your letter gave me a great deal of pain.
3997_180297_000030_000009 We are sometimes obliged to buy the satisfaction of our souls at the expense of our bodies, and we suffer still more, when, afterward, that satisfaction is denied us."
3997_180297_000031_000000 I listened, and I gazed at Marguerite with admiration.
3997_180297_000032_000003 Our hearts have their caprices; it is their one distraction and their one excuse.
3997_180297_000032_000005 Because when you saw me spitting blood you took my hand; because you wept; because you are the only human being who has ever pitied me.
3997_180297_000032_000007 When he died I cried more than when my mother died.
3997_180297_000032_000008 It is true that for twelve years of her life she used to beat me.
3997_180297_000032_000009 Well, I loved you all at once, as much as my dog.
3997_180297_000033_000000 "Your letter undeceived me; it showed me that you lacked the intelligence of the heart; it did you more harm with me than anything you could possibly have done.
3997_180297_000033_000001 It was jealousy certainly, but ironical and impertinent jealousy.
3997_180297_000033_000002 I was already feeling sad when I received your letter.
3997_180297_000033_000003 I was looking forward to seeing you at twelve, to having lunch with you, and wiping out, by seeing you, a thought which was with me incessantly, and which, before I knew you, I had no difficulty in tolerating.
3997_180297_000034_000002 Naturally we have no friends.
3997_180297_000034_000004 For these people we have to be merry when they are merry, well when they want to sup, sceptics like themselves.
3997_180297_000034_000005 We are not allowed to have hearts, under penalty of being hooted down and of ruining our credit.
3997_180297_000035_000000 "We no longer belong to ourselves.
3997_180297_000035_000001 We are no longer beings, but things. We stand first in their self esteem, last in their esteem.
3997_180297_000035_000003 Then they become our friends, or rather our guests at table.
3997_180297_000035_000004 Their friendship is carried to the point of servility, never to that of disinterestedness.
3997_180297_000035_000005 Never do they give you advice which is not lucrative.
3997_180297_000037_000000 "Then I met you, young, ardent, happy, and I tried to make you the man I had longed for in my noisy solitude.
3997_180297_000037_000002 You do not accept the position, you reject it as unworthy of you; you are an ordinary lover. Do like the others; pay me, and say no more about it."
3997_180297_000039_000000 "Pardon, pardon," I murmured.
3997_180297_000039_000002 Forget the rest and remember only one thing: that we belong to one another, that we are young, and that we love.
3997_180297_000040_000000 Marguerite drew the letter from her bosom, and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness, said:
3997_180297_000041_000000 "Here it is.
3997_180297_000042_000000 I tore the letter into fragments and kissed with tears the hand that gave it to me.
3997_180297_000043_000000 At this moment Prudence reappeared.
3997_180297_000044_000000 "Look here, Prudence; do you know what he wants?" said Marguerite.
3997_180297_000045_000000 "He wants you to forgive him."
3997_180297_000046_000000 "Precisely."
3997_180297_000047_000000 "And you do?"
3997_180297_000048_000000 "One has to; but he wants more than that."
3997_180297_000049_000000 "What, then?"
3997_180297_000050_000000 "He wants to have supper with us."
3997_180297_000051_000000 "And do you consent?"
3997_180297_000052_000000 "What do you think?"
3997_180297_000053_000000 "I think that you are two children who haven't an atom of sense between you; but I also think that I am very hungry, and that the sooner you consent the sooner we shall have supper."
3997_180297_000054_000000 "Come," said Marguerite, "there is room for the three of us in my carriage."
3997_180297_000055_000000 "By the way," she added, turning to me, "Nanine will be gone to bed.
3997_180297_000055_000001 You must open the door; take my key, and try not to lose it again."
3997_180297_000056_000000 I embraced Marguerite until she was almost stifled.
3997_180297_000057_000000 Thereupon Joseph entered.
3997_180297_000059_000000 "All of it?"
3997_180297_000060_000000 "Yes, sir."
3997_182399_000000_000000 twelve
3997_182399_000001_000000 WHY THERE IS A BLACK HEAD IN THE BUZZARD FAMILY
3997_182399_000002_000000 ol' Mistah Buzzard had just told the story of why he has a bald head and is proud of it.
3997_182399_000002_000001 You know he hasn't a feather on it, and it is very, very red.
3997_182399_000002_000002 It was a very interesting story, and it had been listened to with the closest attention by a lot of the little meadow and forest people.
3997_182399_000004_000000 "Cert'nly, Brer Possum.
3997_182399_000004_000001 Cert'nly," replied ol' Mistah Buzzard.
3997_182399_000006_000001 Everybody looked surprised.
3997_182399_000006_000002 You see, no one ever had heard him called anything but Buzzard.
3997_182399_000006_000003 But no one said anything, and after a minute or two ol' Mistah Buzzard explained.
3997_182399_000007_000000 "Mah fam'ly name is Vulture," said he.
3997_182399_000011_000000 peter Rabbit pricked up his ears.
3997_182399_000011_000001 This sounded like another story.
3997_182399_000011_000002 He was curious about that black headed cousin of ol' Mistah Buzzard, very curious indeed.
3997_182399_000012_000000 "If you please, how does your cousin happen to have a black head?" asked peter as politely as he knew how.
3997_182399_000013_000000 "Because his grandpap asked too many questions," replied ol' Mistah Buzzard, slyly winking at the others.
3997_182399_000014_000000 Everybody laughed, for everybody knows that no one asks more questions than peter Rabbit.
3997_182399_000014_000001 peter laughed with the rest, although he looked a wee bit foolish.
3997_182399_000014_000003 Oh, my, no!
3997_182399_000015_000000 "Please, mr Buzzard, please tell us the story," he begged.
3997_182399_000016_000000 Now ol' Mistah Buzzard is naturally good-natured and accommodating, and when peter begged so hard, he just couldn't find it in his heart to refuse.
3997_182399_000016_000001 Besides, he rather enjoys telling stories.
3997_182399_000018_000000 Everybody looked at peter and laughed.
3997_182399_000018_000001 peter made a funny face and laughed too.
3997_182399_000021_000000 "Why, I thought it was warm down south!" interrupted peter Rabbit.
3997_182399_000022_000000 "So it is, Brer Rabbit!
3997_182399_000025_000001 But he don't mind that.
3997_182399_000027_000002 She so scared she tip over a whole kettleful of soup right in the fire.
3997_182399_000027_000003 Of course that make a terrible mess an' a powerful lot of smoke an' hot ashes fly up the chimney.
3997_182399_000027_000004 They like to choke that no 'count Buzzard to death.
3997_182399_000029_000000 A little sigh of satisfaction went around the circle of listeners.
3997_182399_000029_000001 As usual, peter Rabbit was the first to speak.
3997_182399_000030_000000 "That was a splendid story, mr Buzzard," said he, "and I'm ever and ever so much obliged to you.
4077_13751_000006_000004 At that time there may have been and probably were many times that number who had professed adherence to the newly restored faith; but as the requirements of the law governing the formation of religious societies were satisfied by the application of six, only the specified number formally took part. Such was the beginning of the Church, soon to be so universally maligned.
4077_13751_000006_000005 Its origin was small-a germ, an insignificant seed, hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition.
4077_13751_000006_000008 At first but a family affair, opposition to the work has involved successively the town, the county, the state, the country, and today the "Mormon" question has been accorded extended consideration at the hands of the national government, and indeed most civilized nations have taken cognizance of the same.
4077_13751_000007_000000 Let us observe the contrast between the beginning and the present proportions of the Church.
4077_13751_000007_000004 Nevertheless, the mustard seed, among the smallest of all seeds, has attained the proportions of a tree, and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches; the acorn is now an oak offering protection and the sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pilgrim journeying its way for truth.
4077_13751_000008_000001 Their eyes were from the first turned in anticipation toward the evening sun-not merely that the work of proselyting should be carried on in the west, but that the headquarters of the Church should be there established.
4077_13751_000010_000000 The first well established seat of the Church was in the pretty little town of Kirtland, Ohio, almost within sight of Lake Erie; and here soon rose the first temple of modern times.
4077_13751_000011_000000 Within two years of its dedication, the temple in Kirtland was abandoned by the people, who were compelled to flee for their lives before the onslaughts of mobocrats; but a second temple, larger and more beautiful than the first, soon reared its spires in the city of Nauvoo, Illinois.
4077_13751_000014_000008 Their gathering is to be like that of the Jews at Jerusalem-a pacific one, and in their taking possession of what they regard as a land of promise, no one previously located there shall be denied his rights.
4077_13751_000015_000001 An appeal was made to the executive of the state, but little encouragement was returned.
4077_13751_000017_000005 The national executive, Andrew Jackson, while expressing sympathy for the persecuted people, deplored his lack of power to interfere with the administration or non administration of state laws; the national officials could do nothing; the state officials would do naught.
4077_13751_000018_000003 No respect was paid to age or sex; grey heads, and infant lips that scarcely had learned to lisp a word, vigorous manhood and immature youth, mother and maiden, fared alike in the scene of carnage, and their bodies were thrown into an old well.
4077_13751_000019_000003 But tools were not wanting, as indeed they never have been, for murder and its kindred outrages.
4077_13751_000019_000004 What the heart of man can conceive, the hand of man will find a way to execute.
4077_13751_000019_000005 The awful work was carried out with dread dispatch.
4077_13751_000019_000006 Oh, what a record to read; what a picture to gaze upon; how awful the fact! An official edict offering expatriation or death to a peaceable community with no crime proved against them, and guilty of no offense other than that of choosing to differ in opinion from the masses!
4077_13751_000019_000007 American school boys read with emotions of horror of the Albigenses, driven, beaten and killed, with a papal legate directing the butchery; and of the Vaudois, hunted and hounded like beasts as the effect of a royal decree; and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scenes as terrible as these in the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hate.
4077_13751_000020_000003 There their sad condition evoked for a time general commiseration.
4077_13751_000023_000000 Who began the quarrel?
4077_13751_000023_000001 Was it the "Mormons?" Is it not notorious on the contrary that they were hunted like wild beasts from county to county before they made any resistance?
4077_13751_000023_000005 Have any who plundered and openly insulted the "Mormons" ever been brought to the punishment due to their crimes? Let boasting murderers of begging and helpless infancy answer!
4077_13751_000025_000000 We have no language sufficiently strong for the expression of our indignation and shame at the recent transaction in a sister state, and that state, Missouri, a state of which we had long been proud, alike for her men and history, but now so fallen that we could wish her star stricken from the bright constellation of the Union.
4077_13754_000001_000000 After all, the "Mormon" people regard the advent of the Buchanan army as one of the greatest material blessings ever brought to them.
4077_13754_000002_000000 The troops, once in Utah, had to be provisioned; and everything the settlers could spare was eagerly bought at an unusual price. The gold changed hands.
4077_13754_000002_000001 Then, in their hasty departure, the soldiers disposed of everything outside of actual necessities in the way of accouterment and camp equipage.
4077_13754_000002_000002 The army found the people in poverty, and left them in comparative wealth.
4077_13754_000003_000000 And what was the cause of this hurried departure of the military? For many months, ominous rumblings had been heard,--indications of the gathering storm which was soon to break in the awful fury of civil strife.
4077_13754_000003_000001 It could not be doubted that war was imminent; already the conflict had begun, and a picked part of the army was away in the western wilds, doing nothing for any phase of the public good.
4077_13754_000003_000002 But a word further concerning the expedition in general.
4077_13754_000003_000004 The movement has been called not inaptly "Buchanan's blunder," but the best and wisest men may make blunders, and whatever may be said of President Buchanan's short sightedness in taking this step, even his enemies do not question his integrity in the matter.
4077_13754_000003_000005 He was unjustly charged with favoring secession; but the charge was soon disproved.
4077_13754_000004_000000 However, it was known that certain of his cabinet were in league with the seceding states; and prominent among them was john Floyd, secretary of war.
4077_13754_000004_000001 The successful efforts of this officer to disarm the North, while accumulating the munitions of war in the South; to scatter the forces by locating them in widely separated and remote stations; and in other ways to dispose of the regular army in the manner best calculated to favor the anticipated rebellion, are matters of history.
4077_13754_000004_000002 It is also told how, at the commencement of the rebellion, he allied himself with the confederate forces, accepting the rank of brigadier general. It was through Floyd's advice that Buchanan ordered the military expedition to Utah, ostensibly to install certain federal officials and to repress an alleged infantile rebellion which in fact had never come into existence, but in reality to further the interests of the secessionists.
4077_13754_000004_000003 When the history of that great struggle with its antecedent and its consequent circumstances is written with a pen that shall indite naught but truth, when prejudice and partisanship are lived down, it may appear that Jefferson Davis rather than james Buchanan was the prime cause of the great mistake.
4077_13754_000005_000001 He left Utah in the early stages of the rebellion, turned his arms against the flag he had sworn to defend, doffed the blue, donned the grey, and fell a rebel on the field of Shiloh.
4077_13754_000006_000000 Changes many and great followed in bewildering succession in Utah.
4077_13754_000006_000001 The people were besought to take sides with the South in the awful scenes of cruel strife; it was openly stated in the east that Utah had allied herself with the cause of secession; and by others that the design was to make Salt Lake City the capital of an independent government.
4077_13754_000006_000002 And surely such conjectures were pardonable on the part of all whose ignorance and prejudice still nursed the delusion of "Mormon" disloyalty. Moreover, had the people been inclined to rebellion what greater opportunity could they have wished?
4077_13754_000006_000003 Already a North and a South were talked of-why not set up also a West?
4077_13754_000006_000004 A supreme opportunity had come and how was it used?
4077_13754_000008_000000 The "Mormon" people saw in their terrible experiences and in the outrages to which they had been subjected, only the mal administration of laws and the subversion of justice through human incapacity and hatred.
4077_13754_000010_000000 But let us turn more particularly to the history of the Church itself.
4077_13754_000010_000002 But "Mormonism" died not; every added pang of grief served but to unite the people.
4077_13754_000011_000003 He was a man with clear title as one of the small brotherhood we call great.
4077_13754_000011_000006 With his death closed another epoch in the history of his people, and a successor arose, one who was capable of leading and judging under the changed conditions.
4077_13754_000013_000000 But perhaps I am suspected of having forgotten or of having intentionally omitted reference to what popular belief once considered the chief feature of "Mormonism," the cornerstone of the structure, the secret of its influence over its members, and of its attractiveness to its proselytes, viz., the peculiarity of the "Mormon" institution of marriage.
4077_13754_000013_000001 The Latter day Saints were long regarded as a polygamous people.
4077_13754_000013_000005 Yet the two have often been confused in the popular mind.
4077_13754_000014_000000 We believe in a literal resurrection and an actual hereafter, in which future state shall be recognized every sanctified and authorized relationship existing here on earth-of parent and child, brother and sister, husband and wife.
4077_13754_000014_000001 We believe, further that contracts as of marriage, to be valid beyond the veil of mortality must be sanctioned by a power greater than that of earth.
4077_13754_000014_000002 With the seal of the holy Priesthood upon their wedded state, these people believe implicitly in the perpetuity of that relationship on the far side of the grave.
4077_13754_000014_000004 Sad as have been the experiences of the people in consequence of this practise, deep and anguish laden as have been the sighs and groans, hot and bitter as have been the tears so caused, the heaviest persecution, the cruelest treatment of their history began before plural marriage was known in the Church.
4077_13754_000016_000001 To them marriage is not, can never be, a civil compact alone; its significance reaches beyond the grave; its obligations are eternal; and the Latter day Saints are notable for the sanctity with which they invest the marital state.
4077_13754_000017_000000 At the inception of plural marriage among the Latter day Saints, there was no law, national or state, against its practise.
4077_13754_000017_000001 This statement assumes, as granted, a distinction between bigamy and the "Mormon" institution of plural marriage.
4077_13754_000017_000002 In eighteen sixty two, a law was enacted with the purpose of suppressing plural marriage, and, as had been predicted in the national Senate prior to its passage, it lay for many years a dead letter.
4077_13754_000017_000003 Federal judges and United States attorneys in Utah, who were not "Mormons" nor lovers of "Mormonism," refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law, because of its manifest injustice and inadequacy. But other laws followed, most of which, as the Latter day Saints believe, were aimed directly at their religious conception of the marriage contract, and not at social impropriety nor sexual offense.
4077_13754_000018_000000 At last the Edmunds Tucker act took effect, making not the marriage alone but the subsequent acknowledging of the contract an offense punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.
4077_13754_000020_000000 The people contested these measures one by one in the courts; presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject, and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure.
4077_13754_000020_000002 But the people have suspended the practise of plural marriage; and the testimony of the governors, judges, and district attorneys of the territory, and later that of the officers of the state, have declared the sincerity of the renunciation.
4077_13754_000021_000000 As the people had adopted the practise under what was believed to be divine approval, they suspended it when they were justified in so doing.
4077_13754_000021_000001 In whatever light this practise has been regarded in the past, it is today a dead issue, forbidden by ecclesiastical rule as it is prohibited by legal statute.
4077_13754_000021_000002 And the world is learning, to its manifest surprise, that plural marriage and "Mormonism" are not synonymous terms.
4077_13754_000023_000000 And so the story of "Mormonism" runs on; its finale has not yet been written; the current press presents continuously new stages of its progress, new developments of its plan.
4077_13754_000023_000001 Today the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is stronger than ever before; and the people are confident that it is at its weakest stage for all time to come.
4077_13754_000023_000004 Its creed provides for the protection of all men in their rights of worship according to the dictates of conscience.
4198_12259_000001_000018 But this shall banish it utterly.
4198_12259_000001_000020 Long clysters of drinking are to be voided without doors.
4198_12259_000001_000021 The great God made the planets, and we make the platters neat.
4198_12259_000001_000022 I have the word of the gospel in my mouth, Sitio.
4198_12259_000001_000024 Appetite comes with eating, says Angeston, but the thirst goes away with drinking.
4198_12259_000001_000025 I have a remedy against thirst, quite contrary to that which is good against the biting of a mad dog.
4198_12259_000001_000027 There I catch you, I awake you.
4198_12259_000001_000029 Hey now, lads, let us moisten ourselves, it will be time to dry hereafter.
4198_12259_000001_000031 My tongue peels.
4198_12259_000001_000035 I'faith, pure Greek, Greek!
4198_12259_000001_000040 My 'prenticeship is out, I am a free man at this trade.
4198_12259_000001_000043 O the drinkers, those that are a dry, O poor thirsty souls!
4198_12259_000001_000045 Like a cardinal!
4198_12259_000001_000046 Natura abhorret vacuum.
4198_12259_000001_000048 This is after the fashion of Switzerland.
4198_12259_000001_000050 Come, therefore, blades, to this divine liquor and celestial juice, swill it over heartily, and spare not!
4198_12281_000004_000000 How a monk of Seville saved the close of the abbey from being ransacked by the enemy.
4198_12281_000006_000002 Whence comes this to pass, my masters?
4198_12281_000006_000004 The town being thus pillaged, they went unto the abbey with a horrible noise and tumult, but they found it shut and made fast against them.
4198_12281_000006_000005 Whereupon the body of the army marched forward towards a pass or ford called the Gue de Vede, except seven companies of foot and two hundred lancers, who, staying there, broke down the walls of the close, to waste, spoil, and make havoc of all the vines and vintage within that place.
4198_12281_000006_000007 Nevertheless, at all adventures they rang the bells ad capitulum capitulantes.
4198_12281_000007_000002 By the virtue of God, why do not you sing, Panniers, farewell, vintage is done?
4198_12281_000007_000005 Lord God! da mihi potum.
4198_12281_000007_000006 Then said the prior of the convent: What should this drunken fellow do here?
4198_12281_000007_000007 let him be carried to prison for troubling the divine service.
4198_12281_000007_000008 Nay, said the monk, the wine service, let us behave ourselves so that it be not troubled; for you yourself, my lord prior, love to drink of the best, and so doth every honest man.
4198_12281_000007_000011 Wherefore is it, that our devotions were instituted to be short in the time of harvest and vintage, and long in the advent, and all the winter?
4198_12281_000008_000005 If any offered to hide himself amongst the thickest of the vines, he laid him squat as a flounder, bruised the ridge of his back, and dashed his reins like a dog.
4198_12281_000008_000013 To others through their ballocks he pierced their bumgut, and left not bowel, tripe, nor entrail in their body that had not felt the impetuosity, fierceness, and fury of his violence.
4198_12281_000008_000014 Believe, that it was the most horrible spectacle that ever one saw.
4198_12281_000008_000021 Others shouted as loud as they could Confession, Confession, Confiteor, Miserere, In manus!
4198_12281_000008_000022 So great was the cry of the wounded, that the prior of the abbey with all his monks came forth, who, when they saw these poor wretches so slain amongst the vines, and wounded to death, confessed some of them.
4198_12281_000008_000024 To which he answered that they should cut the throats of those he had thrown down upon the ground.
4198_12281_000008_000030 But when those that had been shriven would have gone out at the gap of the said breach, the sturdy monk quashed and felled them down with blows, saying, These men have had confession and are penitent souls; they have got their absolution and gained the pardons; they go into paradise as straight as a sickle, or as the way is to Faye (like Crooked Lane at Eastcheap).
4198_61336_000000_000002 He appears to have been a popular leader of the revolt against Ashur nirari, who, like certain of his predecessors, had pronounced pro Babylonian tendencies.
4198_61336_000000_000003 It is significant to note in this connection that the new king was an unswerving adherent of the cult of Ashur, by the adherents of which he was probably strongly supported.
4198_61336_000001_000000 Tiglath pileser combined in equal measure those qualities of generalship and statesmanship which were necessary for the reorganization of the Assyrian state and the revival of its military prestige.
4198_61336_000001_000001 At the beginning of his reign there was much social discontent and suffering.
4198_61336_000001_000002 The national exchequer had been exhausted by the loss of tribute from revolting provinces, trade was paralysed, and the industries were in a languishing condition.
4198_61336_000001_000003 Plundering bands of Aramaeans were menacing the western frontiers and had overrun part of northern Babylonia.
4198_61336_000003_000000 Tiglath pileser did not overrun Chaldaea, but he destroyed its capital, Sarrabanu, and impaled King Nabu ushabshi.
4198_61336_000003_000001 He proclaimed himself "King of Sumer and Akkad" and "King of the Four Quarters".
4198_61336_000003_000002 The frontier states of Elam and Media were visited and subdued.
4198_61336_000005_000000 At this time the reputation of Tiglath pileser hung in the balance.
4198_61336_000005_000001 If he failed in his attack on Urartu, his prestige would vanish at home and abroad and Sharduris might, after establishing himself in northern Syria, invade Assyria and compel its allegiance.
4198_61336_000006_000002 The latter appeared to him to be the most feasible and judicious procedure, for if he succeeded in expelling the invaders he would at the same time compel the allegiance of the rebellious Hittite states.
4198_61336_000007_000000 In the spring of seven forty three b c
4198_61336_000007_000001 Tiglath pileser led his army across the Euphrates and reached Arpad without meeting with any resistance.
4198_61336_000007_000003 Its foreign garrison was slaughtered.
4198_61336_000010_000002 For three years he conducted vigorous campaigns in "the western land", where he met with vigorous resistance.
4198_61336_000010_000003 In seven forty b c
4198_61336_000010_000005 Two years later Kullani and Hamath fell, and the districts which they controlled were included in the Assyrian empire and governed by Crown officials.
4198_61336_000011_000000 Once again the hebrews came into contact with Assyria.
4198_61336_000011_000001 The Dynasty of Jehu had come to an end by this time.
4198_61336_000012_000000 Supported by Assyria, the kings of Israel had become powerful and haughty.
4198_61336_000012_000004 A contemptuous answer was returned.
4198_61336_000013_000002 But Amaziah would not hear.
4198_61336_000013_000004 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.
4198_61336_000015_000001 About seven seventy three b c he appears to have co operated with Assyria and conquered Damascus and Hamath.
4198_61336_000015_000002 His son Zachariah, the last king of the Jehu Dynasty of Israel, came to the throne in seven forty b c towards the close of the reign of Azariah, son of Amaziah, king of Judah.
4198_61336_000015_000003 Six months afterwards he was assassinated by Shallum.
4198_61336_000015_000004 This usurper held sway at Samaria for only a month.
4198_61336_000017_000000 Tiglath pileser next operated against the Median and other hill tribes in the north-east.
4198_61336_000018_000000 Tiglath pileser had to content himself by devastating the city on the plain and the neighbouring villages.
4198_61336_000019_000000 In the following year Tiglath pileser returned to Syria.
4198_61336_000019_000001 The circumstances which made this expedition necessary are of special interest on account of its Biblical associations.
4198_61336_000020_000000 Judah had taken advantage of the disturbed conditions in Israel to assert its independence.
4198_61336_000020_000001 The walls of Jerusalem were repaired by Jotham, father of Ahaz, and a tunnel constructed to supply it with water.
4198_61336_000021_000000 Pekah had to deal with a powerful party in Israel which favoured the re establishment of David's kingdom in Palestine.
4198_61336_000021_000001 Their most prominent leader was the prophet amos, whose eloquent exhortations were couched in no uncertain terms.
4198_61336_000021_000002 He condemned Israel for its idolatries, and cried:
4198_61336_000022_000000 For thus saith the Lord unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me and ye shall live....
4198_61336_000023_000000 Pekah sought to extinguish the orthodox party's movement by subduing Judah.
4198_61336_000024_000000 Thus saith the Lord....
4198_61336_000024_000001 I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which will devour the palaces of Ben hadad.
4198_61336_000024_000002 I will break also the bar of Damascus ... and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir....
4198_61336_000024_000003 The remnant of the Philistines shall perish.
4198_61336_000026_000000 isaiah visited Ahaz and said,
4198_61336_000027_000000 Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint hearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
4198_61336_000029_000000 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up and save me out of the hand of Syria and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.
4198_61336_000030_000000 Tiglath pileser recorded that Rezin took refuge in his city like "a mouse".
4198_61336_000030_000001 Israel was also dealt with.
4198_61336_000032_000001 He swept through Israel "like a hurricane".
4198_61336_000032_000002 The Philistines and the Arabians of the desert were also subdued.
4198_61336_000033_000000 Babylon next claimed the attention of Tiglath pileser.
4198_61336_000033_000001 Nabonassar had died and was succeeded by his son Nabu nadin zeri, who, after reigning for two years, was slain in a rebellion.
4198_61336_000034_000001 He was met with a stubborn resistance.
4198_61336_000034_000003 Two years afterwards Tiglath pileser returned, captured Shapia, and restored peace throughout Babylonia.
4198_61336_000034_000004 He was welcomed in Babylon, which opened its gates to him, and he had himself proclaimed king of Sumer and Akkad. The Chaldaeans paid tribute.
4198_61336_000035_000000 Tiglath pileser had now reached the height of his ambition.
4198_61336_000035_000001 He had not only extended his empire in the west from Cappadocia to the river of Egypt, crippled Urartu and pacified his eastern frontier, but brought Assyria into close union with Babylonia, the mother land, the home of culture and the land of the ancient gods.
4198_61336_000036_000001 Little is known regarding his brief reign.
4198_61336_000037_000000 Apparently Hoshea, king of Israel, pretended when the Assyrians entered his country that he remained friendly.
4198_61336_000037_000001 Shalmaneser, however, was well informed, and made Hoshea a prisoner.
4198_61336_000037_000002 Samaria closed its gates against him although their king had been dispatched to Assyria.
4198_61336_000040_000000 Shalmaneser died before Samaria was captured, and may have been assassinated.
4198_61336_000040_000003 He was the Assyrian monarch who deported the "Lost Ten Tribes".
4198_61336_000042_000002 Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
4198_61336_000043_000001 This man was evidently an orthodox Hebrew, for he taught them "how they should fear the Lord....
4198_61336_000047_000000 Trouble was brewing in Syria.
4198_61336_000047_000003 His return in Sargon's reign was evidently connected with the new rising in which he took part.
4294_14317_000001_000003 chap.
4294_14317_000003_000000 THE FIRST piece I cast in bronze was that great bust, the portrait of his Excellency, which I had modelled in the goldsmith  s workroom while suffering from those pains in my back.
4294_14317_000003_000002 I was of course aware that the admirable sculptor Donatello had cast his bronzes with the clay of Florence; yet it seemed to me that he had met with enormous difficulties in their execution.
4294_14317_000003_000003 As I thought that this was due to some fault in the earth, I wanted to make these first experiments before I undertook my Perseus.
4294_14317_000004_000002 The first cast I took in my furnace succeeded in the superlative degree, and was so clean that my friends thought I should not need to retouch it.
4294_14317_000005_000003 I felt compelled to complain pretty sharply to his Excellency; and having gone to wait on him one morning in the Via de  Servi, I spoke as follows:   My lord, I do not now receive the monies necessary for my task, which makes me fear that your Excellency has lost confidence in me.
4294_14317_000005_000004 Once more then I tell you that I feel quite able to execute this statue three times better than the model, as I have before engaged my word.
4294_14317_000008_000002 To prove the truth of these words, I need only remind your Excellency of Donatello and the great Lionardo da Vinci in the past, and of our incomparable Michel Angelo Buonarroti in the present; they augment the glory of your Excellency by their genius. I in my turn feel the same desire and hope to play my part like them; therefore, my lord, give me the leave to go.
4294_14317_000008_000004 Now grant me my permission, prince!
4294_14317_000009_000003 He kept indeed enticing me to push this job forward by daytime also; but I would not consent, although I felt sure I should incur his anger.
4294_14317_000009_000005 But, as I suppose your Excellency is joking, I will add no more.  He replied that, far from joking, he meant solemn earnest.
4294_14317_000009_000008 There!
4294_14317_000009_000009 I have mentioned one.  I said:   My lord, I thank you, and beg you to condescend so far as to listen to four words.
4294_14317_000009_000010 It is true that he lent me a pair of old scales, two anvils, and three little hammers, which articles I begged his workman, Giorgio da Cortona, fifteen days ago, to fetch back.
4294_14317_000009_000014 Domenico Poggini and Gianpagolo his brother, who are present, will confirm my words; for I spoke to them at once about it, and since that time have never once alluded to the matter, because your Excellency told me I did not understand these things, which made me think you wanted to keep up the credit of your stone.
4294_14317_000009_000015 I should like you to know, my lord, that I do understand, and that, as regards my character, I consider myself no less honest than any man who ever lived upon this earth.
4294_14317_000009_000016 I shall not try to rob you of eight or ten thousand ducats at one go, but shall rather seek to earn them by my industry.
4294_14317_000010_000003 You had better put this to the proof, and I will go at once to the Bargello.  The Duke made answer:   Benvenuto, do your best to be an honest man, as you have done until now; you have no cause for apprehension.  So the whole matter passed off in smoke, and I heard not one more word about it.
4294_14317_000010_000005 She then desired me to fasten it upon her breast, and handed me a large pin, with which I fixed it, and took my leave in her good favour.
4294_14317_000016_000000 I BELIEVE have already narrated how Domenico and Giovanpagolo Poggini, goldsmiths and brothers, were at work in the Duke  s wardrobe upon some little golden vases, after my design, chased with figures in bas relief, and other ornaments of great distinction.
4294_14317_000017_000003 I moved heaven and earth to get back the body of the vase, which he had begun badly, as I have already said, together with the remainder of the silver.
4294_14317_000017_000004 The Duke, hearing something of these disputes, sent for the vase and the models, and never told me why or wherefore. Suffice it to say, that he placed some of my designs in the hands of divers persons at Venice and elsewhere, and was very ill served by them.
4294_14317_000018_000001 I frequently replied that everybody, nay, all Italy, knew well I was an excellent goldsmith; but Italy had not yet seen what I could do in sculpture. Among artists, certain enraged sculptors laughed at me, and called me the new sculptor.
4294_14317_000018_000003 When I took them to her Excellency, she received me most graciously, and repaid the gold and silver I had spent upon them.
4294_14317_000018_000004 Then I made my suit to her and prayed her tell the Duke that I was getting small assistance for so great a work; I begged her also to warn him not to lend so ready an ear to Bandinello  s evil tongue, which hindered me from finishing my Perseus.
4294_14317_000021_000001 I had to pay the workmen out of my own pocket; for the Duke, after giving Lattanzio Gorini orders to discharge their wages, at the end of about eighteen months, grew tired, and withdrew this subsidy.
4294_14317_000021_000002 I asked Lattanzio why he did not pay me as usual.
4294_14317_000021_000004 One thinks that you will never get it done.  In a rage I up and answered:   May the plague catch you and all who dare to think I shall not finish it!
4294_14317_000022_000002 One day on one of these occasions, I mounted a nice nag I had, put a hundred crowns in my purse, and went to Fiesole to visit a natural son of mine there, who was at nurse with my gossip, the wife of one of my workpeople.
4294_14317_000022_000003 When I reached the house, I found the boy in good health, and kissed him, very sad at heart.
4294_14317_000022_000004 On taking leave, he would not let me go, but held me with his little hands and a tempest of cries and tears.
4294_14317_000022_000007 Taking the road toward Florence, just when I entered the piazza of San Domenico, Bandinello was arriving from the other side.
4294_14317_000022_000009 No sooner did he catch sight of me than he turned the colour of a corpse, and trembled from head to foot.
4294_14317_000022_000010 Perceiving at once how base the business would be, I exclaimed:   Fear not, vile coward!
4294_14317_000022_000011 I do not condescend to smite you.  He looked at me submissively and said nothing.
4294_14317_000022_000012 Thereupon I recovered command of my faculties, and thanked God that His goodness had withheld me from so great an act of violence.
4294_32859_000004_000000 CHAPTER four.
4294_32859_000005_000000 IN WHICH WE GO TO THE DRAWING ROOM AND THE PARTY BREAKS UP.
4294_32859_000006_000000 Wylder was surprised, puzzled, and a good deal incensed-that saucy craft had fired her shot so unexpectedly across his bows.
4294_32859_000006_000002 He would have talked to ugly mrs w Wylder, his sister in law, at his left, but she was entertaining Lord Chelford now.
4294_32859_000006_000004 He would have liked, at that moment, a walk upon the quarter deck, with a good head wind blowing, and liberty to curse and swear a bit over the bulwark.
4294_32859_000006_000005 Women are so full of caprice and hypocrisy, and 'humbugging impudence!'
4294_32859_000007_000000 Wylder was rather surly after the ladies had floated away from the scene, and he drank his liquor doggedly.
4294_32859_000007_000001 It was his fancy, I suppose, to revive certain sentimental relations which had, it may be, once existed between him and Miss Lake; and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnifies an object in proportion as its pursuit is thwarted.
4294_32859_000010_000000 'What thing?
4294_32859_000010_000001 my dear Miss Lake,' said that good little woman, skipping to her side.
4294_32859_000011_000000 'The story of "Fridolin," and Retzch's pretty outlines.
4294_32859_000011_000001 Sit down beside me, and I'll tell you the story.'
4294_32859_000013_000000 After a while, in a pet, he walked away.
4294_32859_000015_000000 Then he joined a conversation going on between Dorcas Brandon and the vicar, his brother.
4294_32859_000015_000001 He assisted at it, but took no part, and in fact was listening to that other conversation which sounded, with its pleasant gabble and laughter, like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance.
4294_32859_000015_000002 His gall rose, and that distant talk rang in his ears like a cool but intangible insult.
4294_32859_000016_000000 It was dull work.
4294_32859_000017_000000 Mark clapped on his hat, and rifled the pocket of his paletot of his cigar case and matches, and spluttered a curse or two, according to old Nollekins' receipt for easing the mind, and on the door steps lighted his cheroot, and became gradually more philosophical.
4294_32859_000019_000000 So Mark waited to put the lady into the carriage, and he meditated walking a little way by the window and making his peace, and there was perhaps some vague vision of jumping in afterwards; I know not.
4294_32859_000019_000001 Mark's ideas of ladies and of propriety were low, and he was little better than a sailor ashore, and not a good specimen of that class of monster.
4294_35475_000000_000001 When the poor Prince saw his brothers riding out into the world to win their fortunes, he fain would have followed.
4294_35475_000000_000002 Throwing himself on his knees before the King, he cried, "Oh, royal Sire, bestow upon me also a sword and a steed, that I may up and away to follow my brethren."
4294_35475_000001_000000 But the King laughed him to scorn.
4294_35475_000001_000001 "Thou a sword!" he quoth.
4294_35475_000002_000000 Now just at that moment it happened that the Court Tailor came into the room to measure the King for a new mantle of ermine.
4294_35475_000002_000001 Forthwith the grinning Jester began shrieking with laughter, so that the bells upon his motley cap were all set a jangling.
4294_35475_000003_000000 "What now, Fool?" demanded the King.
4294_35475_000004_000000 "I did but laugh to think the sword of Ethelried had been so quickly found," responded the Jester, and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the Tailor's girdle.
4294_35475_000006_000001 "Until that far day, now get thee gone!"
4294_35475_000007_000000 So Ethelried left the palace, and wandered away over mountain and moor with a heavy heart.
4294_35475_000007_000001 No one knew that he was a prince; no fireside offered him welcome; no lips gave him a friendly greeting.
4294_35475_000007_000002 The scissors hung useless and rusting by his side.
4294_35475_000008_000000 One night as he lay in a deep forest, too unhappy to sleep, he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes.
4294_35475_000008_000001 By the light of the moon he saw that a ferocious wild beast had been caught in a hunter's snare, and was struggling to free itself from the heavy net.
4294_35475_000008_000002 His first thought was to slay the animal, for he had had no meat for many days.
4294_35475_000009_000000 While he stood gazing at the struggling beast, it turned to him with such a beseeching look in its wild eyes, that he was moved to pity.
4294_35475_000010_000001 Better dead than this craven life to which my father hath doomed me!"
4294_35475_000011_000000 So he set to work with the little scissors to cut the great ropes of the net in twain.
4294_35475_000011_000002 Great beads of sweat stood out on his brow as he bent himself to the task.
4294_35475_000012_000000 Presently, as he worked, the blades began to grow sharper and sharper, and brighter and brighter, and longer and longer.
4294_35475_000013_000000 At last he raised the net to let the beast go free.
4294_35475_000013_000001 Then he sank on his knees in astonishment.
4294_35475_000014_000001 It was he who changed me into the form of a wild beast, and set the snare to capture me.
4294_35475_000015_000000 At this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder.
4294_35475_000015_000001 "'tis the Ogre!" cried the Fairy.
4294_35475_000015_000002 "We must hasten." Seizing the scissors that lay on the ground where Ethelried had dropped them, she opened and shut them several times, exclaiming:
4294_35475_000016_000000 "Scissors, grow a giant's height And save us from the Ogre's might!"
4294_35475_000018_000000 The Fairy darted down the path thus opened up, and Ethelried followed as fast as he could, for the horrible roaring was rapidly coming nearer.
4294_35475_000018_000001 At last they reached a wide chasm that bounded the Ogre's domain.
4294_35475_000018_000002 Once across that, they would be out of his power, but it seemed impossible to cross.
4294_35475_000018_000003 Again the Fairy touched the scissors, saying:
4294_35475_000019_000000 "Giant scissors, bridge the path, And save us from the Ogre's wrath."
4294_35475_000020_000000 Again the scissors grew longer and longer, until they lay across the chasm like a shining bridge.
4294_35475_000020_000001 Ethelried hurried across after the Fairy, trembling and dizzy, for the Ogre was now almost upon them.
4294_35475_000020_000002 As soon as they were safe on the other side, the Fairy blew upon the scissors, and, presto, they became shorter and shorter until they were only the length of an ordinary sword.
4294_35475_000021_000001 But remember that thou canst not keep them sharp and shining, unless they are used at least once each day in some unselfish service."
4294_35475_000022_000000 Before he could thank her she had vanished, and he was left in the forest alone.
4294_35475_000023_000000 The sight was so terrible, that he turned on his heel, and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him.
4294_35475_000023_000001 By the time he reached the edge of the forest he was very tired, and ready to faint from hunger.
4294_35475_000023_000003 He had spent his last coin and knew not where to go for another.
4294_35475_000024_000000 Just then he spied a tree, hanging full of great, yellow apples.
4294_35475_000025_000001 "Well, you shall never steal again, that I promise you.
4294_35475_000026_000001 He was thrust into the dungeon and left there all day.
4294_35475_000027_000001 But the next morning no one came to take him to the gallows, and he sat all day in total darkness.
4294_35475_000031_000001 It was the Fly, which had alighted on his shoulder.
4294_35475_000032_000001 But escape is possible.
4294_35475_000032_000002 Your prison door is of iron, but the shutter which bars the window is only of wood.
4294_35475_000032_000005 I shall make my escape thereat and go to repay thy unselfish service to me.
4294_35475_000032_000006 But know that the scissors move only when bidden in rhyme.
4294_35475_000032_000007 Farewell."
4294_35475_000033_000000 The Prince spent all the following time until midnight, trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors.
4294_35475_000033_000001 The art of rhyming had been neglected in his early education, and it was not until the first cock crowing began that he succeeded in making this one:
4294_35475_000034_000000 "Giant scissors, serve me well, And save me from the Witch's spell!"
4294_35475_000035_000001 In a very short time the Prince had crawled through the opening.
4294_35475_000035_000002 There he stood, outside the dungeon, but it was a dark night and he knew not which way to turn.
4294_35475_000036_000000 He could hear Frog eye Fearsome snoring like a tempest up in the watch tower, and the old Witch was talking in her sleep in seven languages.
4294_35475_000036_000001 While he stood looking around him in bewilderment, a Firefly alighted on his arm.
4294_35475_000036_000002 Flashing its little lantern in the Prince's face, it cried, "This way!
4294_35475_000036_000003 My friend, the Fly, sent me to guide you to a place of safety.
4294_35475_000036_000004 Follow me and trust entirely to my guidance."
4294_35475_000037_000000 The Prince flung his mantle over his shoulder, and followed on with all possible speed.
4294_35475_000040_000000 Soon he came to a tiny hut where a sick man lay moaning, while his wife and children wept beside him.
4294_35475_000040_000001 "What is to become of me?" cried the poor peasant.
4294_35475_000040_000002 "My grain must fall and rot in the field from overripeness because I have not the strength to rise and harvest it; then indeed must we all starve."
4294_35475_000041_000001 They were so rusty from long idleness that he could scarcely move them.
4294_35475_000042_000000 However, he toiled on all night, slowly cutting down the grain stalk by stalk.
4294_35475_000042_000001 Towards morning the scissors became brighter and sharper, until they finally began to open and shut of their own accord.
4294_35475_000042_000002 The whole field was cut by sunrise.
4294_35475_000043_000002 When he had cut it loose and carried it home, the shepherd also became his firm friend, and would have gone through fire and water to serve him.
4294_35475_000044_000000 The grandame whom he supplied with fagots, the merchant whom he rescued from robbers, the King's councillor to whom he gave aid, all became his friends.
4294_35475_000045_000000 Day by day the scissors grew sharper and sharper and ever more quick to spring forward at his bidding.
4294_35475_000046_000000 One day a herald dashed down the highway, shouting through his silver trumpet that a beautiful Princess had been carried away by the Ogre.
4294_35475_000046_000002 To him who could bring her back to her father's castle should be given the throne and kingdom, as well as the Princess herself.
4294_35475_000047_000001 One by one their brave heads were cut off and stuck on poles along the moat that surrounded the castle.
4294_35475_000048_000000 Still the beautiful Princess languished in her prison.
4294_35475_000049_000000 They were brave men, and they would not have feared to meet the fiercest wild beasts, but many shrunk back when the Ogre came rushing out.
4294_35475_000050_000000 Among those who drew back were Ethelried's brothers (the three that were dark and the three that were fair).
4294_35475_000050_000001 They would not acknowledge their fear.
4294_35475_000050_000002 They said, "We are only waiting to lay some wily plan to capture the Ogre."
4294_35475_000052_000000 After several days Ethelried reached the place on foot.
4294_35475_000052_000001 "See him," laughed one of the brothers that was dark to one that was fair.
4294_35475_000052_000002 "He comes afoot; no prancing steed, no waving plumes, no trusty sword; little and lorn, he is not fit to be called a brother to princes."
4294_35475_000053_000000 But Ethelried heeded not their taunts.
4294_35475_000053_000001 He dashed across the drawbridge, and, opening his scissors, cried:
4294_35475_000054_000000 "Giant scissors, rise in power! Grant me my heart's desire this hour!"
4294_35475_000055_000002 Bang!
4294_35475_000056_000001 By this time a great many people, attracted by the terrific noise, had come running up to the moat.
4294_35475_000056_000003 The peasant was there, and the shepherd, and the lords and beggars and high born dames, all those whom Ethelried had ever befriended.
4294_35475_000058_000000 "He saved my harvest," cried one.
4294_35475_000058_000001 "He found my lamb," cried another.
4294_35475_000058_000003 And so they went on, each telling of some unselfish service that the Prince had rendered him.
4294_35475_000059_000000 Every cap was thrown up, and such cheering rent the air as has never been heard since.
4294_35475_000059_000001 They did not know his name, they did not know that he was Prince Ethelried, but they knew by his valor that there was royal blood in his veins.
4294_35475_000061_000000 "Nay," he said.
4294_35475_000061_000002 Keep all but the Princess."
4294_35475_000062_000000 So the Ogre was killed, and the Prince came into his kingdom that was his heart's desire.
4294_9934_000004_000000 Marius was gloomy.
4294_9934_000004_000002 He affirmed to himself that he would not.
4294_9934_000004_000003 He declared to himself that he would not doubt, and he began to doubt in spite of himself.
4294_9934_000004_000004 To stand between two religions, from one of which you have not as yet emerged, and another into which you have not yet entered, is intolerable; and twilight is pleasing only to bat like souls.
4294_9934_000004_000005 Marius was clear eyed, and he required the true light.
4294_9934_000004_000006 The half lights of doubt pained him.
4294_9934_000004_000007 Whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was, he could not halt there, he was irresistibly constrained to continue, to advance, to examine, to think, to march further.
4294_9934_000004_000008 Whither would this lead him?
4294_9934_000004_000009 He feared, after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father, to now take a step which should estrange him from that father.
4294_9934_000004_000010 His discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him.
4294_9934_000004_000011 An escarpment rose around him.
4294_9934_000004_000013 He ceased to go to the Cafe Musain.
4294_9934_000005_000000 In the troubled state of his conscience, he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence.
4294_9934_000005_000002 They soon elbowed him abruptly.
4294_9934_000007_000000 "Monsieur Courfeyrac answered for you."
4294_9934_000008_000000 "Yes."
4294_9934_000009_000000 "But I must have my money."
4294_9934_000010_000000 "Request Courfeyrac to come and talk with me," said Marius.
4294_9934_000011_000000 Courfeyrac having made his appearance, the host left them.
4294_9934_000012_000000 "What is to become of you?" said Courfeyrac.
4294_9934_000013_000000 "I do not know in the least," replied Marius.
4294_9934_000014_000000 "What are you going to do?"
4294_9934_000015_000000 "I do not know."
4294_9934_000016_000000 "Have you any money?"
4294_9934_000017_000000 "Fifteen francs."
4294_9934_000018_000000 "Do you want me to lend you some?"
4294_9934_000019_000000 "Never."
4294_9934_000020_000000 "Have you clothes?"
4294_9934_000021_000000 "Here is what I have."
4294_9934_000022_000000 "Have you trinkets?"
4294_9934_000023_000000 "A watch."
4294_9934_000024_000000 "Silver?"
4294_9934_000025_000000 "Gold; here it is."
4294_9934_000027_000000 "That is good."
4294_9934_000028_000000 "You will then have only a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, a hat and a coat."
4294_9934_000029_000000 "And my boots."
4294_9934_000030_000001 What opulence!"
4294_9934_000031_000000 "That will be enough."
4294_9934_000032_000000 "I know a watchmaker who will buy your watch."
4294_9934_000033_000000 "That is good."
4294_9934_000034_000000 "No; it is not good.
4294_9934_000034_000001 What will you do after that?"
4294_9934_000035_000000 "Whatever is necessary.
4294_9934_000035_000001 Anything honest, that is to say."
4294_9934_000036_000000 "Do you know English?"
4294_9934_000038_000000 "Do you know German?"
4294_9934_000040_000000 "So much the worse."
4294_9934_000041_000000 "Why?"
4294_9934_000042_000000 "Because one of my friends, a publisher, is getting up a sort of an encyclopaedia, for which you might have translated English or German articles.
4294_9934_000042_000001 It is badly paid work, but one can live by it."
4294_9934_000044_000000 "And in the meanwhile?"
4294_9934_000045_000000 "In the meanwhile I will live on my clothes and my watch."
4294_9934_000046_000000 The clothes dealer was sent for.
4294_9934_000046_000001 He paid twenty francs for the cast off garments.
4294_9934_000046_000002 They went to the watchmaker's.
4294_9934_000046_000003 He bought the watch for forty five francs.
4294_9934_000047_000000 "That is not bad," said Marius to Courfeyrac, on their return to the hotel, "with my fifteen francs, that makes eighty."
4294_9934_000048_000000 "And the hotel bill?" observed Courfeyrac.
4294_9934_000050_000000 The landlord presented his bill, which had to be paid on the spot.
4294_9934_000051_000000 "I have ten francs left," said Marius.
4294_9934_000052_000001 That will be swallowing a tongue very fast, or a hundred sous very slowly."
4294_9934_000053_000000 In the meantime Aunt Gillenormand, a rather good hearted person at bottom in difficulties, had finally hunted up Marius' abode.
4294_9934_000055_000001 At that moment, he had three francs left.
4294_9934_000056_000000 His aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of exasperating him.
4294_9934_000056_000001 Besides, had he not said: "Let me never hear the name of that blood drinker again!"
4350_10919_000001_000000 Chapter one
4350_10919_000002_000000 At the end of the winter, in the Shtcherbatskys' house, a consultation was being held, which was to pronounce on the state of Kitty's health and the measures to be taken to restore her failing strength.
4350_10919_000002_000001 She had been ill, and as spring came on she grew worse.
4350_10919_000002_000002 The family doctor gave her cod liver oil, then iron, then nitrate of silver, but as the first and the second and the third were alike in doing no good, and as his advice when spring came was to go abroad, a celebrated physician was called in.
4350_10919_000002_000003 The celebrated physician, a very handsome man, still youngish, asked to examine the patient.
4350_10919_000003_000002 The prince frowned and coughed, listening to the doctor.
4350_10919_000003_000004 "Conceited blockhead!" he thought, as he listened to the celebrated doctor's chatter about his daughter's symptoms.
4350_10919_000003_000005 The doctor was meantime with difficulty restraining the expression of his contempt for this old gentleman, and with difficulty condescending to the level of his intelligence.
4350_10919_000003_000006 He perceived that it was no good talking to the old man, and that the principal person in the house was the mother.
4350_10919_000003_000007 Before her he decided to scatter his pearls.
4350_10919_000003_000009 The prince withdrew, trying not to show how ridiculous he thought the whole performance.
4350_10919_000003_000010 The princess was distracted, and did not know what to do.
4350_10919_000003_000011 She felt she had sinned against Kitty.
4350_10919_000004_000000 "Well, doctor, decide our fate," said the princess.
4350_10919_000004_000001 "Tell me everything."
4350_10919_000005_000000 "Is there hope?" she meant to say, but her lips quivered, and she could not utter the question.
4350_10919_000005_000001 "Well, doctor?"
4350_10919_000006_000000 "Immediately, princess.
4350_10919_000006_000001 I will talk it over with my colleague, and then I will have the honor of laying my opinion before you."
4350_10919_000007_000000 "So we had better leave you?"
4350_10919_000008_000000 "As you please."
4350_10919_000011_000000 "Yes," said he.
4350_10919_000011_000001 "But..."
4350_10919_000012_000000 The family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations.
4350_10919_000013_000000 "The commencement of the tuberculous process we are not, as you are aware, able to define; till there are cavities, there is nothing definite.
4350_10919_000013_000001 But we may suspect it.
4350_10919_000013_000002 And there are indications; malnutrition, nervous excitability, and so on.
4350_10919_000013_000003 The question stands thus: in presence of indications of tuberculous process, what is to be done to maintain nutrition?"
4350_10919_000015_000000 "Yes, that's an understood thing," responded the celebrated physician, again glancing at his watch.
4350_10919_000015_000001 "Beg pardon, is the Yausky bridge done yet, or shall I have to drive around?" he asked.
4350_10919_000015_000002 "Ah! it is.
4350_10919_000015_000003 Oh, well, then I can do it in twenty minutes.
4350_10919_000015_000004 So we were saying the problem may be put thus: to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerves.
4350_10919_000016_000000 "And how about a tour abroad?" asked the family doctor.
4350_10919_000017_000000 "I've no liking for foreign tours.
4350_10919_000018_000000 The family doctor listened attentively and respectfully.
4350_10919_000019_000000 "But in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habits, the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences.
4350_10919_000020_000001 Well, in that case, to be sure, let them go.
4350_10919_000020_000002 Only, those German quacks are mischievous....
4350_10919_000020_000003 They ought to be persuaded....
4350_10919_000022_000000 "Oh! time's up already," And he went to the door.
4350_10919_000022_000001 The celebrated doctor announced to the princess (a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so) that he ought to see the patient once more.
4350_10919_000024_000000 "Oh, no, only a few details, princess."
4350_10919_000025_000000 "Come this way."
4350_10919_000026_000000 And the mother, accompanied by the doctor, went into the drawing room to Kitty.
4350_10919_000026_000001 Wasted and flushed, with a peculiar glitter in her eyes, left there by the agony of shame she had been put through, Kitty stood in the middle of the room.
4350_10919_000026_000002 When the doctor came in she flushed crimson, and her eyes filled with tears.
4350_10919_000026_000003 All her illness and treatment struck her as a thing so stupid, ludicrous even!
4350_10919_000026_000004 Doctoring her seemed to her as absurd as putting together the pieces of a broken vase.
4350_10919_000026_000005 Her heart was broken. Why would they try to cure her with pills and powders?
4350_10919_000026_000006 But she could not grieve her mother, especially as her mother considered herself to blame.
4350_10919_000028_000000 He sat down with a smile, facing her, felt her pulse, and again began asking her tiresome questions.
4350_10919_000028_000001 She answered him, and all at once got up, furious.
4350_10919_000029_000000 "Excuse me, doctor, but there is really no object in this.
4350_10919_000029_000001 This is the third time you've asked me the same thing."
4350_10919_000030_000000 The celebrated doctor did not take offense.
4350_10919_000031_000001 "However, I had finished..."
4350_10919_000032_000000 And the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess, as an exceptionally intelligent woman, the condition of the young princess, and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters, which were certainly harmless.
4350_10919_000032_000002 the doctor plunged into deep meditation, as though resolving a weighty problem. Finally his decision was pronounced: they were to go abroad, but to put no faith in foreign quacks, and to apply to him in any need.
4350_10919_000033_000000 It seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone.
4350_10919_000033_000001 The mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter, and Kitty pretended to be more cheerful.
4350_9170_000001_000000 This is absolutely incorrect.
4350_9170_000002_000000 The social conception of life, we have seen, consists in the transfer of the aim of life from the individual to groups and their maintenance-to the tribe, family, race, or state.
4350_9170_000003_000000 In the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals, individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interests of the group.
4350_9170_000003_000001 And so it has been, and still is, in fact, in certain groups, the distinction being that they are the most primitive forms of association in the family or tribe or race, or even in the patriarchal state.
4350_9170_000004_000001 The champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority, that is, of violence, with the idea of moral influence, but this connection is quite impossible.
4350_9170_000005_000000 The effect of moral influence on a man is to change his desires and to bend them in the direction of the duty required of him. The man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires.
4350_9170_000005_000001 Authority, in the sense in which the word is ordinarily understood, is a means of forcing a man to act in opposition to his desires.
4350_9170_000005_000003 Nothing can oblige a man to do what he does not choose except physical force, or the threat of it, that is-deprivation of freedom, blows, imprisonment, or threats-easily carried out-of such punishments.
4350_9170_000007_000000 The basis of authority is bodily violence.
4350_9170_000007_000001 The possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an organization of armed men, trained to act in unison in submission to one will.
4350_9170_000007_000002 These bands of armed men, submissive to a single will, are what constitute the army.
4350_9170_000007_000003 The army has always been and still is the basis of power.
4350_9170_000007_000004 Power is always in the hands of those who control the army, and all men in power-from the Roman Caesars to the Russian and German Emperors-take more interest in their army than in anything, and court popularity in the army, knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure.
4350_9170_000011_000000 All the methods of appointing authorities that have been tried, divine right, and election, and heredity, and balloting, and assemblies and parliaments and senate-have all proved ineffectual.
4350_9170_000011_000003 Indeed, it could not be otherwise.
4350_9170_000013_000001 Only under those conditions could the social organization be justified.
4350_9170_000015_000001 As the disposition of individuals to violence diminished, and as the habits of the people became more civilized, and as power grew more social organization demoralized through lack of restraint, this advantage disappeared.
4350_9170_000017_000000 This, put simply, is how it has come to pass.
4350_9170_000018_000002 The larger and stronger groups conquered and absorbed the weaker, and the larger and stronger they became, the more internal feuds disappeared and the more the continuity of the group seemed assured.
4350_9170_000019_000000 The members of a family or tribe, united into one community, are less hostile among themselves, and families and tribes do not die like one man, but have a continuity of existence.
4350_9170_000020_000001 It was produced, on one hand, by the natural growth of population, and, on the other, by struggle and conquest.
4350_9170_000021_000000 After conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions, and so the state conception of life justifies itself. But this justification is never more than temporary.
4350_9170_000021_000001 Internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the dissentient individuals.
4350_9170_000022_000000 Government authority, even if it does suppress private violence, always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence, which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government.
4350_9170_000025_000000 And therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the furthest limit, beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden eggs.
4350_9170_000025_000001 And if the goose lays no more eggs, like the American Indians, negroes, and Fijians, then it is killed in spite of the sincere protests of philanthropists.
4350_9170_000026_000000 The most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch, who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient times subdued by conquest.
4350_9170_000028_000000 So it has always been.
4350_9170_000030_000000 Such has been and still is the condition of all the oppressed, but hitherto they have not recognized the fact.
4350_9170_000031_000000 People have believed, as though it were something fully proved, and so needing no proof, that since all nations have hitherto developed in the form of states, that form of organization is an indispensable condition of the development of humanity.
4350_9170_000033_000000 So it was under the Roman emperors and so it is now.
4350_9170_000033_000001 In spite of the fact that the sense of the uselessness and even injurious effects of state violence is more and more penetrating into men's consciousness, things might have gone on in the same way forever if governments were not under the necessity of constantly increasing their armies in order to maintain their power.
4350_9170_000035_000000 That has always been necessary, and has become more and more necessary with the increased diffusion of education among the masses, with the improved communication between people of the same and of different nationalities.
4350_9170_000035_000001 It has become particularly indispensable now in the face of communism, socialism, anarchism, and the labor movement generally.
4350_9170_000035_000002 Governments feel that it is so, and strengthen the force of their disciplined armies.
4350_9170_000035_000003 [See Footnote]
4350_9170_000037_000000 In the German Reichstag not long ago, in reply to a question why funds were needed for raising the salaries of the under officers, the German Chancellor openly declared that trustworthy under officers were necessary to contend against socialism.
4350_9170_000037_000001 Caprivi only said aloud what every statesman knows and assiduously conceals from the people.
4350_9170_000037_000003 The meaning of Caprivi's speech, put into plain language, is that funds are needed, not to resist foreign foes, but to BUY UNDER OFFICERS to be ready to act against the enslaved toiling masses.
4350_9170_000038_000000 Caprivi incautiously gave utterance to what everyone knows perfectly well, or at least feels vaguely if he does not recognize it, that is, that the existing order of life is as it is, not, as would be natural and right, because the people wish it to be so, but because it is so maintained by state violence, by the army with its BOUGHT UNDER OFFICERS and generals.
4350_9170_000039_000001 And this abnormal order of things is maintained by the army.
4350_9170_000040_000000 Everyone, if he does not recognize this now, will know that it is so at the first attempt at insubordination or at a revolution of the existing order.
4350_9170_000042_000000 To keep their subjects in oppression and to be able to enjoy the fruits of their labor the government must have armed forces.
4350_9170_000043_000000 But there is not only one government.
4350_9170_000043_000002 And so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its neighbor brigands.
4350_9170_000043_000003 Every government is thus involuntarily reduced to the necessity of emulating one another in the increase of their armies.
4350_9170_000044_000000 Every increase in the army of one state, with the aim of self defense against its subjects, becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies.
4350_9170_000046_000000 Both causes, mutually dependent, contribute to the same result at once; troops are required against internal forces and also to keep up a position with other states.
4350_9170_000046_000001 One is the result of the other. The despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes, and the aggressiveness of a government increases with its internal despotism.
4350_9170_000047_000003 And by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practiced upon them; all citizens have become their own oppressors.
4350_9170_000048_000000 Universal military service was an inevitable logical necessity, to which we were bound to come.
4350_9170_000048_000002 This inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service.
4350_9170_000049_000001 But instead of doing that they expose the individuals to the same necessity of strife, substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors.
4350_9170_000053_000000 The taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend.
4350_9170_000054_000000 The withdrawing of all men from the ordinary course of life destroys the possibility of labor itself.
4350_9170_000054_000001 The danger of war, ever ready to break out, renders all reforms of life social life vain and fruitless.
4350_9170_000056_000000 But the fatal significance of universal military service, as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life, is not only apparent in that.
4350_9170_000057_000000 Governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defense, but that is not true.
4350_9170_000058_000001 All civil outbreaks for dynastic or other party reasons, all the executions that follow on such disturbances, all repression of insurrections, and military intervention to break up meetings and to suppress strikes, all forced extortion of taxes, all the iniquitous distributions of land, all the restrictions on labor-are either carried out directly by the military or by the police with the army at their back.
4350_9170_000058_000002 Anyone who serves his time in the army shares the responsibility of all these things, about which he is, in some cases, dubious, while very often they are directly opposed to his conscience.
4350_9170_000058_000004 How can I help asking myself when I take part in such punishments, whether they are just, and whether I ought to assist in carrying them out?
4350_9170_000060_000000 The time has come when the ever growing abuse of power by governments and their struggles with one another has led to their demanding such material and even moral sacrifices from their subjects that everyone is forced to reflect and ask himself, "Can I make these sacrifices?
4350_9170_000060_000001 And for the sake of what am I making them?
4350_9170_000060_000002 I am expected for the sake of the state to make these sacrifices, to renounce everything that can be precious to man-peace, family, security, and human dignity." What is this state, for whose sake such terrible sacrifices have to be made?
4350_9170_000060_000003 And why is it so indispensably necessary?
4350_9170_000061_000000 "Except for the state," they say, "we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country."
4350_9170_000062_000000 But who are these evil disposed persons in our midst from whose attacks we are preserved by the state and its army?
4350_9170_000062_000005 So that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evil disposed persons, even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago, has none whatever now.
4350_9170_000063_000000 "Except for the state," they tell us, "we should not have any religion, education, culture, means of communication, and so on. Without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing any thing."
4350_9170_000063_000001 This argument too was well founded only some centuries ago.
4350_9170_000064_000002 Indeed government is more often an obstacle than an assistance in attaining these aims.
4350_9170_000065_000002 In our day governments not only fail to encourage, but directly hinder every movement by which people try to work out new forms of life for themselves.
4350_9170_000066_000000 "Without governments nations would be enslaved by their neighbors."
4350_9170_000066_000001 It is scarcely necessary to refute this last argument.
4350_9170_000066_000003 The government, they tell us, with its army, is necessary to defend us from neighboring states who might enslave us.
4350_9170_000066_000004 But we know this is what all governments say of one another, and yet we know that all the European nations profess the same principles of liberty and fraternity, and therefore stand in no need of protection against one another.
4350_9170_000066_000005 And if defense against barbarous nations is meant, one thousandth part of the troops now under arms would be amply sufficient for that purpose.
4350_9170_000066_000007 The power of the state, far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors, exposes us, on the contrary, to much greater danger of such attacks.
4350_9170_000067_000001 Even looking at it practically, weighing, that is to say, all the burdens laid on him by the state, no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with state demands and serve in the army, would, in the majority of cases, be more disadvantageous than to refuse to do so.
4350_9170_000068_000000 If the majority of men choose to submit rather than to refuse, it is not the result of sober balancing of advantages and disadvantages, but because they are induced by a kind of hypnotizing process practiced upon them.
4350_9170_000068_000001 In submitting they simply yield to the suggestions given them as orders, without thought or effort of will.
4350_9170_000068_000002 To resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is not capable.
4350_9170_000068_000003 Even apart from the moral significance of compliance or non compliance, considering material advantage only, non compliance will be more advantageous in general.
4350_9170_000070_000004 So much for the comparative disadvantages.
4350_9170_000071_000000 The comparative advantages of compliance and non compliance are as follows:
4446_2271_000001_000001 The nephew of one of the standard Victorian novelists, Mainhall bobbed about among the various literary cliques of London and its outlying suburbs, careful to lose touch with none of them.
4446_2271_000001_000003 In appearance, Mainhall was astonishingly like the conventional stage Englishman of American drama: tall and thin, with high, hitching shoulders and a small head glistening with closely brushed yellow hair.
4446_2271_000001_000006 He had preconceived ideas about everything, and his idea about Americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics.
4446_2271_000003_000000 "It's really quite the best thing MacConnell's done," he explained as they got into a hansom.
4446_2271_000003_000001 "It's tremendously well put on, too.
4446_2271_000003_000003 But Hilda Burgoyne's the hit of the piece. Hugh's written a delightful part for her, and she's quite inexpressible. It's been on only two weeks, and I've been half a dozen times already. I happen to have MacConnell's box for tonight or there'd be no chance of our getting places.
4446_2271_000003_000004 There's everything in seeing Hilda while she's fresh in a part.
4446_2271_000003_000005 She's apt to grow a bit stale after a time.
4446_2271_000004_000001 "Why, I haven't heard of her for-years."
4446_2271_000005_000000 Mainhall laughed.
4446_2271_000005_000002 It's only lately, since MacConnell and his set have got hold of her, that she's come up.
4446_2271_000005_000005 Do you know, Alexander,"--Mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger,--"do you know, I sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself.
4446_2271_000005_000006 In a way, it would be a sacrifice; but, dear me, we do need some one."
4446_2271_000006_000000 Just then they drove up to the Duke of York's, so Alexander did not commit himself, but followed Mainhall into the theatre.
4446_2271_000006_000001 When they entered the stage box on the left the first act was well under way, the scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of Ireland.
4446_2271_000006_000002 As they sat down, a burst of applause drew Alexander's attention to the stage.
4446_2271_000006_000004 She doubtless hasn't thought of me for years." He felt the enthusiasm of the house at once, and in a few moments he was caught up by the current of MacConnell's irresistible comedy.
4446_2271_000006_000005 The audience had come forewarned, evidently, and whenever the ragged slip of a donkey girl ran upon the stage there was a deep murmur of approbation, every one smiled and glowed, and Mainhall hitched his heavy chair a little nearer the brass railing.
4446_2271_000007_000002 It's delightful to hear it in a London theatre.
4446_2271_000007_000003 That laugh, now, when she doubles over at the hips-who ever heard it out of Galway?
4446_2271_000007_000004 She saves her hand, too.
4446_2271_000007_000005 She's at her best in the second act.
4446_2271_000007_000006 She's really MacConnell's poetic motif, you see; makes the whole thing a fairy tale."
4446_2271_000008_000000 The second act opened before Philly Doyle's underground still, with Peggy and her battered donkey come in to smuggle a load of potheen across the bog, and to bring Philly word of what was doing in the world without, and of what was happening along the roadsides and ditches with the first gleam of fine weather.
4446_2271_000008_000001 Alexander, annoyed by Mainhall's sighs and exclamations, watched her with keen, half skeptical interest.
4446_2271_000008_000002 As Mainhall had said, she was the second act; the plot and feeling alike depended upon her lightness of foot, her lightness of touch, upon the shrewdness and deft fancifulness that played alternately, and sometimes together, in her mirthful brown eyes.
4446_2271_000008_000003 When she began to dance, by way of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night, the house broke into a prolonged uproar.
4446_2271_000009_000001 They met a good many acquaintances; Mainhall, indeed, knew almost every one, and he babbled on incontinently, screwing his small head about over his high collar.
4446_2271_000010_000000 "MacConnell, let me introduce mr Bartley Alexander.
4446_2271_000010_000001 I say!
4446_2271_000010_000002 It's going famously to night, Mac.
4446_2271_000010_000003 And what an audience!
4446_2271_000010_000004 You'll never do anything like this again, mark me.
4446_2271_000010_000005 A man writes to the top of his bent only once."
4446_2271_000011_000000 The playwright gave Mainhall a curious look out of his deep set faded eyes and made a wry face.
4446_2271_000011_000001 "And have I done anything so fool as that, now?" he asked.
4446_2271_000012_000002 Dear me, Mac, the girl couldn't possibly be better, you know."
4446_2271_000013_000000 MacConnell grunted.
4446_2271_000014_000000 He nodded curtly and made for the door, dodging acquaintances as he went.
4446_2271_000015_000001 "He's hit terribly hard.
4446_2271_000015_000002 He's been wanting to marry Hilda these three years and more.
4446_2271_000015_000003 She doesn't take up with anybody, you know.
4446_2271_000015_000004 Irene Burgoyne, one of her family, told me in confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning.
4446_2271_000015_000005 One of your countrymen, Alexander, by the way; an American student whom she met in Paris, I believe.
4446_2271_000015_000006 I dare say it's quite true that there's never been any one else." Mainhall vouched for her constancy with a loftiness that made Alexander smile, even while a kind of rapid excitement was tingling through him.
4446_2271_000015_000007 Blinking up at the lights, Mainhall added in his luxurious, worldly way: "She's an elegant little person, and quite capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that.
4446_2271_000015_000008 Here comes Sir Harry Towne.
4446_2271_000015_000009 He's another who's awfully keen about her.
4446_2271_000015_000011 Sir Harry Towne, mr Bartley Alexander, the American engineer."
4446_2271_000016_000000 Sir Harry Towne bowed and said that he had met mr Alexander and his wife in Tokyo.
4446_2271_000017_000000 Mainhall cut in impatiently.
4446_2271_000018_000000 "I say, Sir Harry, the little girl's going famously to night, isn't she?"
4446_2271_000019_000002 The fact is, she's feeling rather seedy, poor child.
4446_2271_000019_000003 Westmere and I were back after the first act, and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself.
4446_2271_000019_000004 A little attack of nerves, possibly."
4446_2271_000020_000000 He bowed as the warning bell rang, and Mainhall whispered: "You know Lord Westmere, of course,--the stooped man with the long gray mustache, talking to Lady Dowle.
4446_2271_000020_000001 Lady Westmere is very fond of Hilda."
4446_2271_000021_000002 For some reason he felt pleased and flattered by the enthusiasm of the audience.
4446_2271_000022_000000 When Alexander returned to his hotel-he shook Mainhall at the door of the theatre-he had some supper brought up to his room, and it was late before he went to bed.
4446_2271_000022_000003 Hilda had never replied to his letter.
4446_2271_000022_000005 When he wrote her that everything was changed for him, he was telling the truth.
4446_2271_000022_000006 After he met Winifred Pemberton he seemed to himself like a different man.
4446_2271_000022_000010 I should torture myself-I couldn't help it." After that it was easy to forget, actually to forget.
4446_2271_000022_000012 He had been in London more or less, but he had never happened to hear of her.
4446_2271_000022_000013 "All the same," he lifted his glass, "here's to you, little Hilda.
4446_2271_000022_000014 You've made things come your way, and I never thought you'd do it.
4446_2271_000023_000000 "Of course," he reflected, "she always had that combination of something homely and sensible, and something utterly wild and daft.
4446_2271_000023_000001 But I never thought she'd do anything.
4446_2271_000023_000002 She hadn't much ambition then, and she was too fond of trifles.
4446_2271_000023_000003 She must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to.
4446_2271_000023_000004 Perhaps she has me to thank for something, after all.
4446_2271_000023_000005 Sometimes a little jolt like that does one good.
4446_2271_000023_000006 She was a daft, generous little thing.
4446_2271_000023_000008 After all, we were awfully young.
4446_2271_000023_000009 It was youth and poverty and proximity, and everything was young and kindly.
4446_2271_000023_000011 I shouldn't wonder- But they've probably spoiled her, so that she'd be tiresome if one met her again."
4446_2271_000024_000000 Bartley smiled and yawned and went to bed.
4446_2273_000000_000000 CHAPTER four
4446_2273_000001_000000 On Sunday afternoon Alexander remembered Miss Burgoyne's invitation and called at her apartment.
4446_2273_000001_000001 He found it a delightful little place and he met charming people there.
4446_2273_000001_000002 Hilda lived alone, attended by a very pretty and competent French servant who answered the door and brought in the tea.
4446_2273_000001_000003 Alexander arrived early, and some twenty odd people dropped in during the course of the afternoon.
4446_2273_000001_000004 Hugh MacConnell came with his sister, and stood about, managing his tea cup awkwardly and watching every one out of his deep set, faded eyes.
4446_2273_000001_000005 He seemed to have made a resolute effort at tidiness of attire, and his sister, a robust, florid woman with a splendid joviality about her, kept eyeing his freshly creased clothes apprehensively.
4446_2273_000001_000008 He was never so witty or so sharp here as elsewhere, and Alexander thought he behaved as if he were an elderly relative come in to a young girl's party.
4446_2273_000002_000000 The editor of a monthly review came with his wife, and Lady Kildare, the Irish philanthropist, brought her young nephew, Robert Owen, who had come up from Oxford, and who was visibly excited and gratified by his first introduction to Miss Burgoyne.
4446_2273_000002_000002 Sarah Frost, the novelist, came with her husband, a very genial and placid old scholar who had become slightly deranged upon the subject of the fourth dimension.
4446_2273_000002_000003 On other matters he was perfectly rational and he was easy and pleasing in conversation.
4446_2273_000002_000005 Hilda seemed particularly fond of this quaint couple, and Bartley himself was so pleased with their mild and thoughtful converse that he took his leave when they did, and walked with them over to Oxford Street, where they waited for their 'bus.
4446_2273_000002_000006 They asked him to come to see them in Chelsea, and they spoke very tenderly of Hilda.
4446_2273_000002_000008 There aren't many such left.
4446_2273_000002_000009 American tours have spoiled them, I'm afraid.
4446_2273_000002_000010 They have all grown very smart.
4446_2273_000002_000011 Lamb wouldn't care a great deal about many of them, I fancy."
4446_2273_000003_000000 Alexander went back to Bedford Square a second Sunday afternoon.
4446_2273_000003_000001 He had a long talk with MacConnell, but he got no word with Hilda alone, and he left in a discontented state of mind.
4446_2273_000003_000002 For the rest of the week he was nervous and unsettled, and kept rushing his work as if he were preparing for immediate departure.
4446_2273_000003_000003 On Thursday afternoon he cut short a committee meeting, jumped into a hansom, and drove to Bedford Square.
4446_2273_000003_000004 He sent up his card, but it came back to him with a message scribbled across the front.
4446_2273_000005_000000 h b
4446_2273_000006_000000 When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs.
4446_2273_000006_000001 Hilda was writing in her living room, under the light of a tall desk lamp.
4446_2273_000006_000002 Bartley recognized the primrose satin gown she had worn that first evening at Lady Walford's.
4446_2273_000007_000000 "I'm so pleased that you think me worth that yellow dress, you know," he said, taking her hand and looking her over admiringly from the toes of her canary slippers to her smoothly parted brown hair.
4446_2273_000007_000002 Every one at Lady Walford's was looking at it."
4446_2273_000008_000000 Hilda curtsied.
4446_2273_000008_000002 I've no need for fine clothes in Mac's play this time, so I can afford a few duddies for myself.
4446_2273_000008_000003 It's owing to that same chance, by the way, that I am able to ask you to dinner.
4446_2273_000008_000004 I don't need Marie to dress me this season, so she keeps house for me, and my little Galway girl has gone home for a visit. I should never have asked you if Molly had been here, for I remember you don't like English cookery."
4446_2273_000009_000000 Alexander walked about the room, looking at everything.
4446_2273_000010_000000 "I haven't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I think this is.
4446_2273_000010_000001 Where did you get those etchings?
4446_2273_000010_000002 They're quite unusual, aren't they?"
4446_2273_000011_000000 "Lady Westmere sent them to me from Rome last Christmas.
4446_2273_000011_000003 He painted that group of cypresses for the Salon, and it was bought for the Luxembourg."
4446_2273_000012_000000 Alexander walked over to the bookcases.
4446_2273_000012_000001 "It's the air of the whole place here that I like.
4446_2273_000013_000000 "Rooms always look better by lamplight-in London, at least.
4446_2273_000013_000001 Though Marie is clean-really clean, as the French are.
4446_2273_000013_000003 Marie got them all fresh in Covent Garden market yesterday morning."
4446_2273_000014_000000 "I'm glad," said Alexander simply.
4446_2273_000014_000001 "I can't tell you how glad I am to have you so pretty and comfortable here, and to hear every one saying such nice things about you.
4446_2273_000014_000002 You've got awfully nice friends," he added humbly, picking up a little jade elephant from her desk.
4446_2273_000014_000004 They don't talk of any one else as they do of you."
4446_2273_000015_000000 Hilda sat down on the couch and said seriously: "I've a neat little sum in the bank, too, now, and I own a mite of a hut in Galway.
4446_2273_000015_000001 It's not worth much, but I love it.
4446_2273_000015_000002 I've managed to save something every year, and that with helping my three sisters now and then, and tiding poor Cousin Mike over bad seasons.
4446_2273_000015_000003 He's that gifted, you know, but he will drink and loses more good engagements than other fellows ever get.
4446_2273_000015_000004 And I've traveled a bit, too."
4446_2273_000016_000000 Marie opened the door and smilingly announced that dinner was served.
4446_2273_000017_000000 "My dining room," Hilda explained, as she led the way, "is the tiniest place you have ever seen."
4446_2273_000018_000000 It was a tiny room, hung all round with French prints, above which ran a shelf full of china.
4446_2273_000018_000001 Hilda saw Alexander look up at it.
4446_2273_000019_000000 "It's not particularly rare," she said, "but some of it was my mother's.
4446_2273_000019_000001 Heaven knows how she managed to keep it whole, through all our wanderings, or in what baskets and bundles and theatre trunks it hasn't been stowed away.
4446_2273_000019_000002 We always had our tea out of those blue cups when I was a little girl, sometimes in the queerest lodgings, and sometimes on a trunk at the theatre-queer theatres, for that matter."
4446_2273_000020_000001 There was watercress soup, and sole, and a delightful omelette stuffed with mushrooms and truffles, and two small rare ducklings, and artichokes, and a dry yellow Rhone wine of which Bartley had always been very fond.
4446_2273_000020_000002 He drank it appreciatively and remarked that there was still no other he liked so well.
4446_2273_000021_000000 "I have some champagne for you, too.
4446_2273_000021_000001 I don't drink it myself, but I like to see it behave when it's poured.
4446_2273_000021_000002 There is nothing else that looks so jolly."
4446_2273_000022_000000 "Thank you.
4446_2273_000022_000001 But I don't like it so well as this." Bartley held the yellow wine against the light and squinted into it as he turned the glass slowly about.
4446_2273_000022_000002 "You have traveled, you say.
4446_2273_000022_000003 Have you been in Paris much these late years?"
4446_2273_000023_000000 Hilda lowered one of the candle shades carefully.
4446_2273_000023_000001 "Oh, yes, I go over to Paris often.
4446_2273_000023_000002 There are few changes in the old Quarter.
4446_2273_000024_000000 "Don't I, though!
4446_2273_000024_000001 I'm so sorry to hear it.
4446_2273_000024_000002 How did her son turn out?
4446_2273_000025_000000 "Well, he is still clever and lazy.
4446_2273_000025_000002 He's a big, handsome creature, and he hates Americans as much as ever.
4446_2273_000025_000003 But Angel-do you remember Angel?"
4446_2273_000026_000001 Did she ever get back to Brittany and her bains de mer?"
4446_2273_000027_000002 Too bad!
4446_2273_000027_000004 She did my blouses beautifully the last time I was there, and was so delighted to see me again.
4446_2273_000027_000005 I gave her all my old clothes, even my old hats, though she always wears her Breton headdress.
4446_2273_000027_000006 Her hair is still like flax, and her blue eyes are just like a baby's, and she has the same three freckles on her little nose, and talks about going back to her bains de mer."
4446_2273_000028_000000 Bartley looked at Hilda across the yellow light of the candles and broke into a low, happy laugh.
4446_2273_000028_000001 "How jolly it was being young, Hilda!
4446_2273_000028_000002 Do you remember that first walk we took together in Paris?
4446_2273_000028_000004 Do you remember how sweet they smelled?"
4446_2273_000029_000000 "Indeed I do.
4446_2273_000031_000001 We walked on down by the river, didn't we?"
4446_2273_000032_000000 Hilda laughed and looked at him questioningly.
4446_2273_000033_000001 "It was on the Quai we met that woman who was crying so bitterly.
4446_2273_000033_000002 I gave her a spray of lilac, I remember, and you gave her a franc.
4446_2273_000033_000003 I was frightened at your prodigality."
4446_2273_000034_000000 "I expect it was the last franc I had.
4446_2273_000034_000001 What a strong brown face she had, and very tragic.
4446_2273_000034_000002 She looked at us with such despair and longing, out from under her black shawl.
4446_2273_000034_000003 What she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs, but just our youth.
4446_2273_000034_000004 I remember it touched me so.
4446_2273_000034_000005 I would have given her some of mine off my back, if I could.
4446_2273_000035_000000 They were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money: "God give you a happy love!"
4446_2273_000035_000001 It was not in the ingratiating tone of the habitual beggar: it had come out of the depths of the poor creature's sorrow, vibrating with pity for their youth and despair at the terribleness of human life; it had the anguish of a voice of prophecy.
4446_2273_000035_000002 Until she spoke, Bartley had not realized that he was in love. The strange woman, and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply, had frightened them both.
4446_2273_000035_000003 They went home sadly with the lilacs, back to the Rue Saint Jacques, walking very slowly, arm in arm.
4446_2273_000035_000004 When they reached the house where Hilda lodged, Bartley went across the court with her, and up the dark old stairs to the third landing; and there he had kissed her for the first time.
4446_2273_000035_000005 He had shut his eyes to give him the courage, he remembered, and she had trembled so-
4446_2273_000036_000000 Bartley started when Hilda rang the little bell beside her.
4446_2273_000036_000001 "Dear me, why did you do that?
4446_2273_000036_000002 I had quite forgotten-I was back there.
4446_2273_000036_000003 It was very jolly," he murmured lazily, as Marie came in to take away the coffee.
4446_2273_000037_000000 Hilda laughed and went over to the piano.
4446_2273_000037_000001 "Well, we are neither of us twenty now, you know.
4446_2273_000037_000002 Have I told you about my new play?
4446_2273_000037_000003 Mac is writing one; really for me this time.
4446_2273_000037_000004 You see, I'm coming on."
4446_2273_000038_000001 What kind of a part is it?
4446_2273_000038_000002 Shall you wear yellow gowns?
4446_2273_000038_000003 I hope so."
4446_2273_000040_000000 "No, it isn't a dress up part.
4446_2273_000040_000003 But he's given me some good Irish songs.
4446_2273_000040_000004 Listen."
4446_2273_000041_000000 She sat down at the piano and sang.
4446_2273_000041_000001 When she finished, Alexander shook himself out of a reverie.
4446_2273_000042_000001 You used to sing it so well."
4446_2273_000043_000000 "Nonsense.
4446_2273_000043_000001 Of course I can't really sing, except the way my mother and grandmother did before me.
4446_2273_000043_000002 Most actresses nowadays learn to sing properly, so I tried a master; but he confused me, just!"
4446_2273_000044_000001 "All the same, sing it, Hilda."
4446_2273_000045_000000 Hilda started up from the stool and moved restlessly toward the window. "It's really too warm in this room to sing.
4446_2273_000045_000001 Don't you feel it?"
4446_2273_000046_000000 Alexander went over and opened the window for her.
4446_2273_000046_000001 "Aren't you afraid to let the wind low like that on your neck?
4446_2273_000046_000002 Can't I get a scarf or something?"
4446_2273_000047_000000 "Ask a theatre lady if she's afraid of drafts!" Hilda laughed.
4446_2273_000047_000001 "But perhaps, as I'm so warm-give me your handkerchief.
4446_2273_000047_000004 "Isn't London a tomb on Sunday night?"
4446_2273_000048_000000 Alexander caught the agitation in her voice.
4446_2273_000048_000001 He stood a little behind her, and tried to steady himself as he said: "It's soft and misty.
4446_2273_000048_000002 See how white the stars are."
4446_2273_000049_000000 For a long time neither Hilda nor Bartley spoke.
4446_2273_000050_000000 She caught his handkerchief from her throat and thrust it at him without turning round.
4446_2273_000050_000001 "Here, take it.
4446_2273_000050_000002 You must go now, Bartley.
4446_2273_000050_000003 Good night."
4446_2273_000051_000000 Bartley leaned over her shoulder, without touching her, and whispered in her ear: "You are giving me a chance?"
4446_2273_000052_000000 "Yes.
4446_2273_000052_000001 Take it and go.
4446_2273_000052_000002 This isn't fair, you know.
4446_2273_000052_000003 Good night."
4446_2273_000054_000001 "Are you going to let me love you a little, Bartley?" she whispered.
4446_2275_000001_000000 The last two days of the voyage Bartley found almost intolerable.
4446_2275_000001_000001 The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mersey, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
4446_2275_000002_000000 Emerging at Euston at half past three o'clock in the afternoon, Alexander had his luggage sent to the Savoy and drove at once to Bedford Square.
4446_2275_000002_000002 She blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs. Alexander paced up and down the hallway, buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat, until she returned and took him up to Hilda's living room.
4446_2275_000002_000003 The room was empty when he entered.
4446_2275_000002_000004 A coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already beginning to grow dark outside.
4446_2275_000002_000005 Alexander did not sit down.
4446_2275_000002_000006 He stood his ground over by the windows until Hilda came in.
4446_2275_000002_000007 She called his name on the threshold, but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it. She merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder.
4446_2275_000002_000008 "Oh, what a grand thing to happen on a raw day!
4446_2275_000002_000009 I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up.
4446_2275_000002_000010 I thought it might be Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along.
4446_2275_000002_000011 I never dreamed it would be you, Bartley.
4446_2275_000002_000012 But why do you let me chatter on like this?
4446_2275_000002_000013 Come over to the fire; you're chilled through."
4446_2275_000003_000000 She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire, and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth, her knees drawn up to her chin, laughing like a happy little girl.
4446_2275_000004_000001 You haven't spoken a word."
4446_2275_000005_000000 "I got in about ten minutes ago.
4446_2275_000005_000001 I landed at Liverpool this morning and came down on the boat train."
4446_2275_000006_000000 Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze.
4446_2275_000006_000001 Hilda watched him with perplexity.
4446_2275_000007_000000 "There's something troubling you, Bartley.
4446_2275_000007_000001 What is it?"
4446_2275_000008_000000 Bartley bent lower over the fire.
4446_2275_000008_000002 You and i"
4446_2275_000009_000000 Hilda took a quick, soft breath.
4446_2275_000009_000001 She looked at his heavy shoulders and big, determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash.
4446_2275_000010_000000 "What about us, Bartley?" she asked in a thin voice.
4446_2275_000011_000000 He locked and unlocked his hands over the grate and spread his fingers close to the bluish flame, while the coals crackled and the clock ticked and a street vendor began to call under the window.
4446_2275_000011_000001 At last Alexander brought out one word:--
4446_2275_000012_000000 "Everything!"
4446_2275_000013_000000 Hilda was pale by this time, and her eyes were wide with fright.
4446_2275_000013_000001 She looked about desperately from Bartley to the door, then to the windows, and back again to Bartley.
4446_2275_000013_000002 She rose uncertainly, touched his hair with her hand, then sank back upon her stool.
4446_2275_000014_000000 "I'll do anything you wish me to, Bartley," she said tremulously.
4446_2275_000014_000001 "I can't stand seeing you miserable."
4446_2275_000016_000000 He rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the room, seeming to find it too small for him.
4446_2275_000016_000001 He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.
4446_2275_000018_000000 "It . . . it hasn't always made you miserable, has it?" Her eyelids fell and her lips quivered.
4446_2275_000019_000000 "Always.
4446_2275_000019_000001 But it's worse now.
4446_2275_000019_000002 It's unbearable.
4446_2275_000019_000003 It tortures me every minute."
4446_2275_000020_000000 "But why NOW?" she asked piteously, wringing her hands.
4446_2275_000021_000000 He ignored her question.
4446_2275_000021_000002 "Each life spoils the other.
4446_2275_000021_000003 I get nothing but misery out of either.
4446_2275_000021_000004 The world is all there, just as it used to be, but I can't get at it any more.
4446_2275_000021_000005 There is this deception between me and everything."
4446_2275_000022_000001 She bit her lip and looked down at her hands, which were clasped tightly in front of her.
4446_2275_000023_000000 "Could you-could you sit down and talk about it quietly, Bartley, as if I were a friend, and not some one who had to be defied?"
4446_2275_000024_000000 He dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire.
4446_2275_000024_000002 I have thought about it until I am worn out."
4446_2275_000025_000000 He looked at her and his haggard face softened.
4446_2275_000025_000001 He put out his hand toward her as he looked away again into the fire.
4446_2275_000026_000000 She crept across to him, drawing her stool after her.
4446_2275_000027_000000 "After the very first.
4446_2275_000027_000001 The first was-sort of in play, wasn't it?"
4446_2275_000028_000000 Hilda's face quivered, but she whispered: "Yes, I think it must have been.
4446_2275_000029_000000 Alexander groaned.
4446_2275_000029_000001 "I meant to, but somehow I couldn't.
4446_2275_000029_000002 We had only a few days, and your new play was just on, and you were so happy."
4446_2275_000030_000000 "Yes, I was happy, wasn't I?" She pressed his hand gently in gratitude. "Weren't you happy then, at all?"
4446_2275_000031_000000 She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days.
4446_2275_000031_000001 Something of their troubling sweetness came back to Alexander, too.
4446_2275_000031_000002 He moved uneasily and his chair creaked.
4446_2275_000032_000001 You know.
4446_2275_000033_000000 "Yes, yes," she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him. Presently it stole back to his coat sleeve.
4446_2275_000033_000001 "Please tell me one thing, Bartley.
4446_2275_000033_000002 At least, tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy."
4446_2275_000035_000000 She leaned her head against his arm and spoke softly:--
4446_2275_000036_000000 "You see, my mistake was in wanting you to have everything.
4446_2275_000036_000001 I wanted you to eat all the cakes and have them, too.
4446_2275_000036_000002 I somehow believed that I could take all the bad consequences for you.
4446_2275_000036_000003 I wanted you always to be happy and handsome and successful-to have all the things that a great man ought to have, and, once in a way, the careless holidays that great men are not permitted."
4446_2275_000037_000000 Bartley gave a bitter little laugh, and Hilda looked up and read in the deepening lines of his face that youth and Bartley would not much longer struggle together.
4446_2275_000038_000000 "I understand, Bartley.
4446_2275_000038_000002 But I didn't know.
4446_2275_000038_000003 You've only to tell me now.
4446_2275_000038_000004 What must I do that I've not done, or what must I not do?" She listened intently, but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair.
4446_2275_000038_000005 "You want me to say it?" she whispered.
4446_2275_000038_000006 "You want to tell me that you can only see me like this, as old friends do, or out in the world among people?
4446_2275_000038_000007 I can do that."
4446_2275_000039_000000 "I can't," he said heavily.
4446_2275_000040_000000 Hilda shivered and sat still.
4446_2275_000040_000001 Bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth.
4446_2275_000040_000002 "It's got to be a clean break, Hilda.
4446_2275_000040_000003 I can't see you at all, anywhere.
4446_2275_000040_000004 What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg."
4446_2275_000041_000000 Hilda sprang up like a flame.
4446_2275_000041_000001 She stood over him with her hands clenched at her side, her body rigid.
4446_2275_000042_000000 "No!" she gasped.
4446_2275_000042_000001 "It's too late to ask that.
4446_2275_000042_000003 I won't promise.
4446_2275_000042_000004 It's abominable of you to ask me.
4446_2275_000042_000005 Keep away if you wish; when have I ever followed you?
4446_2275_000042_000006 But, if you come to me, I'll do as I see fit.
4446_2275_000042_000007 The shamefulness of your asking me to do that!
4446_2275_000042_000008 If you come to me, I'll do as I see fit.
4446_2275_000042_000009 Do you understand?
4446_2275_000042_000010 Bartley, you're cowardly!"
4446_2275_000043_000000 Alexander rose and shook himself angrily.
4446_2275_000043_000001 "Yes, I know I'm cowardly. I'm afraid of myself.
4446_2275_000043_000002 I don't trust myself any more.
4446_2275_000043_000003 I carried it all lightly enough at first, but now I don't dare trifle with it.
4446_2275_000043_000004 It's getting the better of me.
4446_2275_000043_000005 It's different now.
4446_2275_000043_000006 I'm growing older, and you've got my young self here with you.
4446_2275_000044_000000 Hilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly.
4446_2275_000044_000002 Why didn't you let me be angry with you?
4446_2275_000044_000003 You ask me to stay away from you because you want me!
4446_2275_000044_000004 And I've got nobody but you.
4446_2275_000044_000005 I will do anything you say-but that!
4446_2275_000044_000006 I will ask the least imaginable, but I must have SOMETHING!"
4446_2275_000045_000000 Bartley turned away and sank down in his chair again.
4446_2275_000045_000001 Hilda sat on the arm of it and put her hands lightly on his shoulders.
4446_2275_000046_000000 "Just something Bartley.
4446_2275_000046_000001 I must have you to think of through the months and months of loneliness.
4446_2275_000046_000002 I must see you.
4446_2275_000046_000003 I must know about you.
4446_2275_000046_000004 The sight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful-can I never make you understand what that means to me?" She pressed his shoulders gently.
4446_2275_000046_000005 "You see, loving some one as I love you makes the whole world different.
4446_2275_000046_000006 If I'd met you later, if I hadn't loved you so well-but that's all over, long ago.
4446_2275_000046_000007 Then came all those years without you, lonely and hurt and discouraged; those decent young fellows and poor Mac, and me never heeding-hard as a steel spring.
4446_2275_000046_000008 And then you came back, not caring very much, but it made no difference."
4446_2275_000047_000000 She slid to the floor beside him, as if she were too tired to sit up any longer.
4446_2275_000047_000001 Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, kissing her mouth and her wet, tired eyes.
4446_2275_000048_000000 "Don't cry, don't cry," he whispered.
4446_2275_000048_000001 "We've tortured each other enough for tonight.
4446_2275_000048_000002 Forget everything except that I am here."
4507_16021_000009_000000 CHAPTER one-ORIGIN
4507_16021_000011_000000 It engenders a whole world, la pegre, for which read theft, and a hell, la pegrenne, for which read hunger.
4507_16021_000013_000000 She has a son, theft, and a daughter, hunger.
4507_16021_000014_000000 Where are we at this moment?
4507_16021_000015_000000 What is slang?
4507_16021_000016_000001 How! Argot!
4507_16021_000016_000002 Why, argot is horrible!
4507_16021_000016_000003 It is the language of prisons, galleys, convicts, of everything that is most abominable in society!" etc, etc
4507_16021_000017_000000 We have never understood this sort of objections.
4507_16021_000018_000002 Slang is odious!
4507_16021_000018_000003 Slang makes one shudder!"
4507_16021_000019_000000 Who denies that?
4507_16021_000019_000001 Of course it does.
4507_16021_000020_000000 When it is a question of probing a wound, a gulf, a society, since when has it been considered wrong to go too far? to go to the bottom?
4507_16021_000020_000003 Why should one halt on the way?
4507_16021_000021_000001 Nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity, in the broad light of thought, of the horrible swarming of slang.
4507_16021_000021_000002 It seems, in fact, to be a sort of horrible beast made for the night which has just been torn from its cesspool.
4507_16021_000021_000003 One thinks one beholds a frightful, living, and bristling thicket which quivers, rustles, wavers, returns to shadow, threatens and glares.
4507_16021_000021_000004 One word resembles a claw, another an extinguished and bleeding eye, such and such a phrase seems to move like the claw of a crab.
4507_16021_000022_000000 Now, when has horror ever excluded study?
4507_16021_000022_000001 Since when has malady banished medicine?
4507_16021_000022_000003 He would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language, a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity.
4507_16021_000022_000004 For, it must be stated to those who are ignorant of the case, that argot is both a literary phenomenon and a social result.
4507_16021_000022_000005 What is slang, properly speaking?
4507_16021_000022_000006 It is the language of wretchedness.
4507_16021_000023_000000 We may be stopped; the fact may be put to us in general terms, which is one way of attenuating it; we may be told, that all trades, professions, it may be added, all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence, have their own slang.
4507_16021_000023_000002 The painter who says: "My grinder," the notary who says: "My Skip the Gutter," the hairdresser who says: "My mealyback," the cobbler who says: "My cub," talks slang. Strictly speaking, if one absolutely insists on the point, all the different fashions of saying the right and the left, the sailor's port and starboard, the scene shifter's court side, and garden side, the beadle's Gospel side and Epistle side, are slang.
4507_16021_000023_000007 The sugar manufacturer who says: "Loaf, clarified, lumps, bastard, common, burnt,"--this honest manufacturer talks slang.
4507_16021_000023_000008 A certain school of criticism twenty years ago, which used to say: "Half of the works of Shakespeare consists of plays upon words and puns,"--talked slang.
4507_16021_000023_000010 The classic Academician who calls flowers "Flora," fruits, "Pomona," the sea, "Neptune," love, "fires," beauty, "charms," a horse, "a courser," the white or tricolored cockade, "the rose of Bellona," the three cornered hat, "Mars' triangle,"--that classical Academician talks slang.
4507_16021_000024_000000 No doubt.
4507_16021_000024_000002 For our part, we reserve to the word its ancient and precise, circumscribed and determined significance, and we restrict slang to slang.
4507_16021_000024_000005 To meet the needs of this conflict, wretchedness has invented a language of combat, which is slang.
4507_16021_000025_000000 To keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion, to hold above the gulf, were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would, otherwise, be lost, that is to say, one of the elements, good or bad, of which civilization is composed, or by which it is complicated, to extend the records of social observation; is to serve civilization itself.
4507_16021_000025_000001 This service Plautus rendered, consciously or unconsciously, by making two Carthaginian soldiers talk Phoenician; that service Moliere rendered, by making so many of his characters talk Levantine and all sorts of dialects.
4507_16021_000025_000003 Phoenician, very good! Levantine, quite right!
4507_16021_000025_000004 Even dialect, let that pass!
4507_16021_000025_000005 They are tongues which have belonged to nations or provinces; but slang!
4507_16021_000025_000006 What is the use of preserving slang?
4507_16021_000026_000000 To this we reply in one word, only.
4507_16021_000026_000001 Assuredly, if the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest, the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study.
4507_16021_000027_000000 It is the language which has been spoken, in France, for example, for more than four centuries, not only by a misery, but by every possible human misery.
4507_16021_000028_000003 Have these historians of hearts and souls duties at all inferior to the historians of external facts?
4507_16021_000028_000004 Does any one think that Alighieri has any fewer things to say than Machiavelli?
4507_16021_000028_000005 Is the under side of civilization any less important than the upper side merely because it is deeper and more sombre?
4507_16021_000029_000000 Let us say, moreover, parenthetically, that from a few words of what precedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classes of historians which does not exist in our mind.
4507_16021_000029_000002 The history of manners and ideas permeates the history of events, and this is true reciprocally.
4507_16021_000029_000003 They constitute two different orders of facts which correspond to each other, which are always interlaced, and which often bring forth results.
4507_16021_000029_000004 All the lineaments which providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels, sombre but distinct, in their depths, and all convulsions of the depths produce ebullitions on the surface.
4507_16021_000029_000005 True history being a mixture of all things, the true historian mingles in everything.
4507_16021_000030_000000 Man is not a circle with a single centre; he is an ellipse with a double focus.
4507_16021_000030_000001 Facts form one of these, and ideas the other.
4507_16021_000031_000001 There it clothes itself in word masks, in metaphor rags.
4507_16021_000031_000002 In this guise it becomes horrible.
4507_16021_000032_000000 One finds it difficult to recognize.
4507_16021_000032_000001 Is it really the French tongue, the great human tongue?
4507_16021_000032_000002 Behold it ready to step upon the stage and to retort upon crime, and prepared for all the employments of the repertory of evil.
4507_16021_000033_000000 When one listens, by the side of honest men, at the portals of society, one overhears the dialogues of those who are on the outside. One distinguishes questions and replies.
4507_16021_000033_000001 One perceives, without understanding it, a hideous murmur, sounding almost like human accents, but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word.
4507_16021_000033_000002 It is slang. The words are misshapen and stamped with an indescribable and fantastic bestiality.
4507_16021_000033_000003 One thinks one hears hydras talking.
4507_16021_000034_000000 It is unintelligible in the dark.
4507_16021_000034_000001 It gnashes and whispers, completing the gloom with mystery.
4507_16021_000034_000002 It is black in misfortune, it is blacker still in crime; these two blacknesses amalgamated, compose slang.
4507_16021_000034_000003 Obscurity in the atmosphere, obscurity in acts, obscurity in voices.
4507_16021_000035_000000 Let us have compassion on the chastised.
4507_16021_000035_000001 Alas!
4507_16021_000035_000002 Who are we ourselves?
4507_16021_000035_000006 The earth is not devoid of resemblance to a jail.
4507_16021_000035_000007 Who knows whether man is not a recaptured offender against divine justice?
4507_16021_000035_000008 Look closely at life.
4507_16021_000035_000009 It is so made, that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment.
4507_16021_000036_000000 Are you what is called a happy man?
4507_16021_000036_000001 Well! you are sad every day.
4507_16021_000036_000002 Each day has its own great grief or its little care.
4507_16021_000036_000004 This without reckoning in the pains of the heart.
4507_16021_000036_000005 And so it goes on.
4507_16021_000036_000006 One cloud is dispelled, another forms.
4507_16021_000036_000007 There is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny.
4507_16021_000036_000008 And you belong to that small class who are happy!
4507_16021_000036_000009 As for the rest of mankind, stagnating night rests upon them.
4507_16021_000037_000000 Thoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase: the fortunate and the unfortunate.
4507_16021_000037_000001 In this world, evidently the vestibule of another, there are no fortunate.
4507_16021_000038_000001 To diminish the number of the shady, to augment the number of the luminous,--that is the object.
4507_16021_000038_000002 That is why we cry: Education! science!
4507_16021_000038_000003 To teach reading, means to light the fire; every syllable spelled out sparkles.
4507_16021_000039_000000 However, he who says light does not, necessarily, say joy.
4507_16021_000039_000001 People suffer in the light; excess burns.
4507_16021_000039_000002 The flame is the enemy of the wing.
4507_16021_000039_000003 To burn without ceasing to fly,--therein lies the marvel of genius.
4507_16021_000040_000000 When you shall have learned to know, and to love, you will still suffer. The day is born in tears.
4852_28311_000001_000000 "o k," he said.
4852_28311_000001_000001 "Only why didn't you ask him yourself?"
4852_28311_000003_000000 "Well-" he admitted, "I did.
4852_28311_000003_000001 Wicker's such a queer old guy.
4852_28311_000006_000000 "So-" Mike swallowed.
4852_28311_000007_000000 Mike stopped and looked at Chris with a comical expression.
4852_28311_000007_000001 "Everybody knows what's outside his window!" he burst out.
4852_28311_000013_000001 Gee!
4852_28311_000013_000002 Whaddaya suppose?"
4852_28311_000014_000001 He spoke cheerfully.
4852_28311_000015_000001 "Think he really needs it?" he pursued.
4852_28311_000017_000000 "You bet he does!
4852_28311_000017_000002 His mother's sick," he repeated, "an' Jakey don' look so good himself."
4852_28311_000019_000000 "I'll go with ya!" Mike announced, as if that finished the argument; which, as a matter of fact, it did.
4852_28311_000021_000000 "Are you coming?" Mike challenged, with a hint of derision.
4852_28311_000022_000000 "Yes," said Chris suddenly, "I'm coming.
4852_28311_000025_000001 Houses and shops thinned suddenly on both sides of the street.
4852_28311_000029_000001 I'm going now."
4852_28311_000030_000000 "o k
4852_28311_000030_000001 Let's see you."
4852_28311_000031_000000 Chris turned his back on Mike and started down the hill.
4852_28311_000031_000001 After a step or two, not finding his friend beside him, he turned.
4852_28311_000031_000002 Mike was standing on the corner.
4852_28311_000032_000001 "You said you were coming with me!"
4852_28311_000033_000000 "Well, I was," Mike howled back, "but I just remembered.
4852_28311_000033_000001 My mother told me to bring her some stuff from the Safeway.
4852_28311_000034_000001 But a chore was a chore, and was never worth discussion.
4852_28311_000036_000000 Chris started off once more, passing the bleak little Victorian church perched on the hill above mr Wicker's house.
4852_28311_000036_000002 Chris paused to look below him.
4852_28311_000036_000003 Even from where he stood, fifty feet above the house, the slope of the hill was sharp and the plan of the house below him could be plainly seen.
4852_28311_000038_000000 His gaze moved back to the house itself.
4852_28311_000040_000003 All at once he wondered how his mother was, and everything in him pinched and tightened itself.
4852_28311_000041_000000 At the foot of the hill he reached the house.
4852_28311_000042_000001 There were three things that always caught his eye, amid the litter of dusty pieces.
4852_28312_000001_000000 William Wicker's face in itself was not forbidding.
4852_28312_000001_000002 The thin lips crackled the withered and multi wrinkled cheeks in the ghost of what had once been a smile.
4852_28312_000001_000004 The double fans of minute wrinkles breaking from eye corner to temple and joining with those over the cheekbones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehead.
4852_28312_000002_000000 mr Wicker's eyes were not those of an old man at all.
4852_28312_000002_000001 They had the vigor of a man in the prime of life, and their presence in that puckered face of age which confronted Chris was horribly disconcerting.
4852_28312_000002_000002 Chris blinked and looked again.
4852_28312_000002_000003 Yes, they were still there.
4852_28312_000004_000001 You wanted something?"
4852_28312_000005_000001 "Yes sir," he said.
4852_28312_000005_000003 "He's a schoolmate of mine.
4852_28312_000006_000000 "I-I just wondered if the place was still open."
4852_28312_000007_000001 What he saw was a fresh cheeked lad tall for thirteen, sturdy, with sincerity and good humor in his face, and something sensitive and appealing about his eyes.
4852_28312_000010_000001 You see, I don't really need it, and Jakey does.
4852_28312_000010_000002 It wouldn't be fair for me to take it if Jakey has a chance."
4852_28312_000011_000001 He guessed there must be a lively fire in that room beyond.
4852_28312_000012_000001 You don't say, on the sign, and Jakey isn't awfully well.
4852_28312_000012_000003 Would that interfere with Jakey's getting the job, sir?" Chris enquired.
4852_28312_000014_000002 Jakey will be cared for, never fear."
4852_28312_000015_000002 He thought he detected a pleasant smell of herbs, like the potpourri his mother had in bowls in their house.
4852_28312_000015_000003 The sharp black outline of mr Wicker impressed itself on his eyeballs, and in the room, now totally dark except for the light that streamed from the faraway open door, mr Wicker's body seemed to radiate a bright edge, like a carbon paper held up to the sun
4852_28312_000018_000002 And why had the sound of wheels, of gears and of horns, been so completely muffled out?
4852_28312_000018_000003 The room seemed overly still.
4852_28312_000019_000000 Then, in that second, he turned and faced about.
4852_28312_000019_000001 The wide bow window was there before him, the three objects he liked best showing frosty in the moonlight that poured in from across the water.
4852_28312_000020_000001 Where was the freeway?
4852_28312_000020_000002 It was no longer there, nor were the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen.
4852_28312_000021_000000 Flabbergasted and breathless, Chris was unaware that he had moved closer to peer out the window in every direction.
4852_28312_000021_000001 No electric signs, no lamplit streets.
4852_28312_000021_000002 Going as far as the wall to his left and leaning forward, Chris looked up toward M Street.
4852_28312_000022_000006 Chris could catch the shine as lantern glow touched the silver buckles on their shoes.
4852_28312_000022_000008 They moved into the inn; the coach rattled off to the stable.
4852_28319_000006_000001 What shall I do first?"
4852_28319_000008_000000 "How you have improved, my boy!" he exclaimed.
4852_28319_000010_000002 "Suppose I change and can't change back?"
4852_28319_000012_000000 "Never fear, Christopher.
4852_28319_000012_000002 If you get stuck I can help you.
4852_28319_000012_000004 Remember Incantation Seventy three, Book One."
4852_28319_000013_000002 mr Wicker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for Chris to get up his courage.
4852_28319_000015_000004 His head swam and he felt faint and a little sick, but he persisted through the final words.
4852_28319_000017_000001 Well, what do you know?
4852_28319_000018_000000 "Better come back now.
4852_28319_000018_000002 Seventy four, Book One: The Return."
4852_28319_000023_000002 "You will do famously, my boy.
4852_28319_000024_000000 From that time, Chris became increasingly proficient, and as his ability grew he began to find magic a wonderful game, which he and mr Wicker played together.
4852_28319_000025_000000 One day Chris wandered alone into the dusty shop.
4852_28319_000025_000003 mr Wicker was busy, and Becky Boozer had gone off to market accompanied by Ned Cilley.
4852_28319_000027_000002 If he was to be a magician, could he make this boy come to life?
4852_28319_000028_000001 Grown people, however gay and kind, were never quite the same.
4852_28319_000028_000002 The more he thought of it, the more Chris knew it had to be attempted.
4852_28319_000028_000003 He squatted on his haunches, examining the carved wooden figure attentively, and felt convinced that, once alive, the boy would be an ideal and happy companion.
4852_28319_000029_000001 Chris got up and stole back to mr Wicker's door.
4852_28319_000030_000001 With difficulty, standing on tiptoe, Chris lifted it down, and placing it on the floor, turned over page after page.
4852_28319_000031_000000 The afternoon, rainy before, increased in storm.
4852_28319_000031_000001 Dusk came two hours before its time; thunder snarled in the sky.
4852_28319_000032_000001 There were the words, and there the charm. Certain elements were to be mixed and poured at the proper time.
4852_28319_000032_000002 He hurried, memorizing as he closed the book, and hoisted it once more to its high shelf.
4852_28319_000033_000000 mr Wicker began moving about upstairs; the floorboards creaked, and still Chris could not leave until the potion fumed and glowed.
4852_28330_000000_000001 They went down to their quarters first. They were really closest to the hatch.
4852_28330_000000_000003 Guess mr Finney went to his quarters-I don't remember seeing him cross the deck or come over that way at all.
4852_28330_000001_000001 It was getting dark.
4852_28330_000001_000002 He joked with the cook at the galley door, and probably went on, for I didn't see him come by again.
4852_28330_000001_000003 Next, Ned Cilley was relieved at the helm by Elbert Jones, who took over.
4852_28330_000001_000004 Ned went on down.
4852_28330_000002_000000 Or did he?
4852_28330_000002_000001 Chris wrinkled his brow with concentration.
4852_28330_000002_000003 It looks to me as if it could have been one of several people, and I'll be switched if I know who.
4852_28330_000002_000005 Maybe whoever it was will give himself away somehow and give me a clue.
4852_28330_000005_000000 Chris lost no time, as soon as he could do it without being noticed, in hurrying down to his cabin.
4852_28330_000013_000000 "Certainly my boy," boomed out the Captain, his blue eyes abruptly keen and penetrating.
4852_28330_000013_000001 "mr Finney will be some time on deck.
4852_28330_000021_000001 We shall say no more, but I trust you understand the responsibility you have?
4852_28330_000022_000001 "Yes sir.
4852_28330_000022_000002 I think I can do it safely, or I should not try, sir."
4852_28330_000023_000002 No doubt.
4852_28330_000025_000000 He then went on to describe what else was to follow-the covering of the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings. Camouflage was not a word the Captain, or anyone else of his time, yet understood.
4852_28330_000026_000001 What can be said during that time, sir?" Chris thought to ask.
4852_28330_000028_000002 I shall say that you are in my own cabin so that I can care for you.
4852_28330_000029_000001 He knew now that his absence, for as long as he had to be away, would be covered up and satisfactorily accounted for.
4852_28330_000031_000000 "Oh sir!" he cried, "mr
4852_28330_000033_000000 Racing to his cabin and back, even in those few seconds Chris could see a change in the sky.
4970_29093_000001_000000 CHAPTER twelve.
4970_29093_000002_000000 "Oh, it's easy enough to make a fortune," Henry said.
4970_29093_000003_000000 "It seems to be easier than it is, I begin to think," replied Philip.
4970_29093_000004_000000 "Well, why don't you go into something?
4970_29093_000004_000001 You'll never dig it out of the Astor Library."
4970_29093_000006_000000 To the young American, here or elsewhere, the paths to fortune are innumerable and all open; there is invitation in the air and success in all his wide horizon.
4970_29093_000006_000001 He is embarrassed which to choose, and is not unlikely to waste years in dallying with his chances, before giving himself to the serious tug and strain of a single object.
4970_29093_000006_000002 He has no traditions to bind him or guide him, and his impulse is to break away from the occupation his father has followed, and make a new way for himself.
4970_29093_000007_000000 Philip Sterling used to say that if he should seriously set himself for ten years to any one of the dozen projects that were in his brain, he felt that he could be a rich man.
4970_29093_000007_000001 He wanted to be rich, he had a sincere desire for a fortune, but for some unaccountable reason he hesitated about addressing himself to the narrow work of getting it.
4970_29093_000010_000000 Delightful illusion of paint and tinsel and silk attire, of cheap sentiment and high and mighty dialogue!
4970_29093_000010_000001 Will there not always be rosin enough for the squeaking fiddle bow?
4970_29093_000012_000000 Philip never was fortunate enough to hear what would become of a man who should lay his hand on a woman with the exception named; but he learned afterwards that the woman who lays her hand on a man, without any exception whatsoever, is always acquitted by the jury.
4970_29093_000013_000000 The fact was, though Philip Sterling did not know it, that he wanted several other things quite as much as he wanted wealth.
4970_29093_000013_000003 If he were good enough he would attach himself to that company of young men in the Theological Seminary, who were seeing New York life in preparation for the ministry.
4970_29093_000014_000002 Philip had a good appetite, a sunny temper, and a clear hearty laugh.
4970_29093_000014_000003 He had brown hair, hazel eyes set wide apart, a broad but not high forehead, and a fresh winning face.
4970_29093_000015_000001 Besides Philip hated the copying of pleadings, and he was certain that a life of "whereases" and "aforesaids" and whipping the devil round the stump, would be intolerable.
4970_29093_000017_000000 His pen therefore, and whereas, and not as aforesaid, strayed off into other scribbling.
4970_29093_000017_000001 In an unfortunate hour, he had two or three papers accepted by first-class magazines, at three dollars the printed page, and, behold, his vocation was open to him.
4970_29093_000017_000002 He would make his mark in literature.
4970_29093_000019_000001 He wanted to begin at the top of the ladder.
4970_29093_000020_000001 It seemed to him that the newspaper managers didn't want genius, but mere plodding and grubbing.
4970_29093_000020_000002 Philip therefore read diligently in the Astor library, planned literary works that should compel attention, and nursed his genius.
4970_29093_000020_000003 He had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into the Dorking Convention, then in session, make a sketch of the men and women on the platform, and take it to the editor of the Daily Grapevine, and see what he could get a line for it.
4970_29093_000022_000000 "Take it of course," says Gringo, "take anything that offers, why not?"
4970_29093_000023_000000 "But they want me to make it an opposition paper."
4970_29093_000024_000000 "Well, make it that.
4970_29093_000024_000001 That party is going to succeed, it's going to elect the next president."
4970_29093_000026_000000 "O, very well," said Gringo, turning away with a shade of contempt, "you'll find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that you can't afford a conscience like that."
4970_29093_000027_000000 But Philip did afford it, and he wrote, thanking his friends, and declining because he said the political scheme would fail, and ought to fail.
4970_29093_000027_000001 And he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world.
4970_29093_000028_000000 It was in this time of rather impatient waiting that Philip was one morning walking down Broadway with Henry Brierly.
4970_29093_000028_000001 He frequently accompanied Henry part way down town to what the latter called his office in Broad Street, to which he went, or pretended to go, with regularity every day.
4970_29093_000028_000004 He never was so summoned, but none of his acquaintances would have been surprised to hear any day that he had gone to Panama or Peoria, or to hear from him that he had bought the Bank of Commerce.
4970_29093_000029_000000 The two were intimate at that time,--they had been classmates-and saw a great deal of each other.
4970_29093_000029_000001 Indeed, they lived together in Ninth Street, in a boarding house, there, which had the honor of lodging and partially feeding several other young fellows of like kidney, who have since gone their several ways into fame or into obscurity.
4970_29093_000031_000000 "I think I should like it of all things," replied Philip, with some hesitation, "but what for."
4970_29093_000032_000000 "Oh, it's a big operation.
4970_29093_000032_000001 We are going, a lot of us, railroad men, engineers, contractors.
4970_29093_000032_000002 You know my uncle is a great railroad man.
4970_29093_000033_000000 "But in what capacity would I go?"
4970_29093_000034_000000 "Well, I'm going as an engineer.
4970_29093_000035_000000 "I don't know an engine from a coal cart."
4970_29093_000036_000000 "Field engineer, civil engineer.
4970_29093_000036_000001 You can begin by carrying a rod, and putting down the figures.
4970_29093_000036_000002 It's easy enough.
4970_29093_000037_000000 "Yes, but what is it for, what is it all about?"
4970_29093_000038_000000 "Why don't you see?
4970_29093_000038_000002 We wouldn't engineer long."
4970_29093_000039_000000 "When do you go?" was Philip's next question, after some moments of silence.
4970_29093_000040_000000 "To morrow.
4970_29093_000041_000000 "No, its not too soon.
4970_29093_000042_000002 It was settled therefore, in the prompt way in which things are settled in New York, that they would start with the rest of the company next morning for the west.
4970_29093_000043_000000 On the way up town these adventurers bought books on engineering, and suits of India rubber, which they supposed they would need in a new and probably damp country, and many other things which nobody ever needed anywhere.
4970_29093_000044_000000 The night was spent in packing up and writing letters, for Philip would not take such an important step without informing his friends.
4970_29093_000044_000001 If they disapprove, thought he, I've done my duty by letting them know.
4970_29093_000044_000002 Happy youth, that is ready to pack its valise, and start for Cathay on an hour's notice.
4970_29093_000046_000000 "Why, it's in Missouri somewhere, on the frontier I think.
4970_29093_000046_000001 We'll get a map."
4970_29093_000047_000000 "Never mind the map.
4970_29093_000047_000001 We will find the place itself.
4970_29093_000047_000002 I was afraid it was nearer home."
4970_29093_000048_000000 Philip wrote a long letter, first of all, to his mother, full of love and glowing anticipations of his new opening.
4970_29093_000048_000001 He wouldn't bother her with business details, but he hoped that the day was not far off when she would see him return, with a moderate fortune, and something to add to the comfort of her advancing years.
4970_29093_000049_000000 To his uncle he said that he had made an arrangement with some New York capitalists to go to Missouri, in a land and railroad operation, which would at least give him a knowledge of the world and not unlikely offer him a business opening.
4970_29093_000049_000001 He knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter.
4970_29093_000050_000000 It was to ruth Bolton that Philip wrote last.
4970_29093_000050_000001 He might never see her again; he went to seek his fortune.
4970_29093_000050_000002 He well knew the perils of the frontier, the savage state of society, the lurking Indians and the dangers of fever.
4970_29093_000050_000003 But there was no real danger to a person who took care of himself.
4970_29093_000050_000004 Might he write to her often and, tell her of his life.
4970_29093_000050_000005 If he returned with a fortune, perhaps and perhaps.
4970_29093_000050_000006 If he was unsuccessful, or if he never returned-perhaps it would be as well.
4970_29093_000050_000007 No time or distance, however, would ever lessen his interest in her.
4970_29093_000050_000008 He would say good night, but not good bye.
4970_29095_000001_000000 CHAPTER fourteen.
4970_29095_000002_000000 The letter that Philip Sterling wrote to ruth Bolton, on the evening of setting out to seek his fortune in the west, found that young lady in her own father's house in Philadelphia.
4970_29095_000002_000001 It was one of the pleasantest of the many charming suburban houses in that hospitable city, which is territorially one of the largest cities in the world, and only prevented from becoming the convenient metropolis of the country by the intrusive strip of Camden and Amboy sand which shuts it off from the Atlantic ocean.
4970_29095_000002_000002 It is a city of steady thrift, the arms of which might well be the deliberate but delicious terrapin that imparts such a royal flavor to its feasts.
4970_29095_000003_000000 It was a spring morning, and perhaps it was the influence of it that made ruth a little restless, satisfied neither with the out doors nor the in doors.
4970_29095_000003_000001 Her sisters had gone to the city to show some country visitors Independence Hall, Girard College and Fairmount Water Works and Park, four objects which Americans cannot die peacefully, even in Naples, without having seen.
4970_29095_000003_000002 But ruth confessed that she was tired of them, and also of the Mint.
4970_29095_000003_000003 She was tired of other things.
4970_29095_000003_000004 She tried this morning an air or two upon the piano, sang a simple song in a sweet but slightly metallic voice, and then seating herself by the open window, read Philip's letter.
4970_29095_000003_000005 Was she thinking about Philip, as she gazed across the fresh lawn over the tree tops to the Chelton Hills, or of that world which his entrance, into her tradition bound life had been one of the means of opening to her?
4970_29095_000003_000006 Whatever she thought, she was not idly musing, as one might see by the expression of her face.
4970_29095_000003_000007 After a time she took up a book; it was a medical work, and to all appearance about as interesting to a girl of eighteen as the statutes at large; but her face was soon aglow over its pages, and she was so absorbed in it that she did not notice the entrance of her mother at the open door.
4970_29095_000004_000000 "ruth?"
4970_29095_000005_000000 "Well, mother," said the young student, looking up, with a shade of impatience.
4970_29095_000006_000000 "I wanted to talk with thee a little about thy plans."
4970_29095_000007_000000 "Mother; thee knows I couldn't stand it at Westfield; the school stifled me, it's a place to turn young people into dried fruit."
4970_29095_000008_000000 "I know," said Margaret Bolton, with a half anxious smile, "thee chafes against all the ways of Friends, but what will thee do?
4970_29095_000008_000001 Why is thee so discontented?"
4970_29095_000009_000000 "If I must say it, mother, I want to go away, and get out of this dead level."
4970_29095_000011_000000 "I hope thee told the elders that father and I are responsible for the piano, and that, much as thee loves music, thee is never in the room when it is played.
4970_29095_000011_000001 Fortunately father is already out of meeting, so they can't discipline him.
4970_29095_000011_000002 I heard father tell cousin Abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now."
4970_29095_000012_000000 "Thy ways greatly try me, ruth, and all thy relations.
4970_29095_000013_000000 "I have not asked him," ruth replied with a look that might imply that she was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her own mind and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with hers.
4970_29095_000015_000000 ruth turned square round to her mother, and with an impassive face and not the slightest change of tone, said,
4970_29095_000017_000000 Margaret Bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity.
4970_29095_000018_000001 A slight frail girl like thee, study medicine! Does thee think thee could stand it six months?
4970_29095_000018_000002 And the lectures, and the dissecting rooms, has thee thought of the dissecting rooms?"
4970_29095_000019_000000 "Mother," said ruth calmly, "I have thought it all over.
4970_29095_000019_000001 I know I can go through the whole, clinics, dissecting room and all.
4970_29095_000019_000002 Does thee think I lack nerve?
4970_29095_000019_000003 What is there to fear in a person dead more than in a person living?"
4970_29095_000020_000000 "But thy health and strength, child; thee can never stand the severe application.
4970_29095_000020_000001 And, besides, suppose thee does learn medicine?"
4970_29095_000021_000000 "I will practice it."
4970_29095_000024_000000 "Where thee and thy family are known?"
4970_29095_000025_000000 "If I can get patients."
4970_29095_000026_000000 "I hope at least, ruth, thee will let us know when thee opens an office," said her mother, with an approach to sarcasm that she rarely indulged in, as she rose and left the room.
4970_29095_000027_000000 ruth sat quite still for a time, with face intent and flushed.
4970_29095_000027_000001 It was out now.
4970_29095_000027_000002 She had begun her open battle.
4970_29095_000028_000000 The sight seers returned in high spirits from the city.
4970_29095_000028_000002 Think of the stone shingles of the roof eight inches thick!
4970_29095_000028_000003 ruth asked the enthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding mausoleum, with its great halls and echoing rooms, and no comfortable place in it for the accommodation of any body?
4970_29095_000028_000004 If they were orphans, would they like to be brought up in a Grecian temple?
4970_29095_000029_000000 And then there was Broad street!
4970_29095_000029_000001 Wasn't it the broadest and the longest street in the world?
4970_29095_000030_000001 The truth is that the country cousins had come to town to attend the Yearly Meeting, and the amount of shopping that preceded that religious event was scarcely exceeded by the preparations for the opera in more worldly circles.
4970_29095_000031_000000 "Is thee going to the Yearly Meeting, ruth?" asked one of the girls.
4970_29095_000032_000000 "I have nothing to wear," replied that demure person.
4970_29095_000032_000001 "If thee wants to see new bonnets, orthodox to a shade and conformed to the letter of the true form, thee must go to the Arch Street Meeting.
4970_29095_000032_000002 Any departure from either color or shape would be instantly taken note of.
4970_29095_000033_000000 "And thee won't go?"
4970_29095_000034_000000 "Why should I? I've been again and again.
4970_29095_000034_000001 If I go to Meeting at all I like best to sit in the quiet old house in Germantown, where the windows are all open and I can see the trees, and hear the stir of the leaves. It's such a crush at the Yearly Meeting at Arch Street, and then there's the row of sleek looking young men who line the curbstone and stare at us as we come out.
4970_29095_000034_000002 No, I don't feel at home there."
4970_29095_000035_000000 That evening ruth and her father sat late by the drawing room fire, as they were quite apt to do at night.
4970_29095_000036_000000 "Thee has another letter from young Sterling," said Eli Bolton.
4970_29095_000037_000000 "Yes.
4970_29095_000037_000001 Philip has gone to the far west."
4970_29095_000038_000000 "How far?"
4970_29095_000039_000000 "He doesn't say, but it's on the frontier, and on the map everything beyond it is marked 'Indians' and 'desert,' and looks as desolate as a Wednesday Meeting."
4970_29095_000040_000001 It was time for him to do something.
4970_29095_000040_000002 Is he going to start a daily newspaper among the Kick a poos?"
4970_29095_000041_000001 He's going into business."
4970_29095_000042_000000 "What sort of business can a young man go into without capital?"
4970_29095_000044_000000 "I should think so, you innocent puss, and in an old one too.
4970_29095_000045_000000 This excellent advice did not seem to impress ruth greatly, for she was looking away with that abstraction of vision which often came into her grey eyes, and at length she exclaimed, with a sort of impatience,
4970_29095_000046_000002 Father, I should like to break things and get loose!"
4970_29095_000047_000000 What a sweet voiced little innocent, it was to be sure.
4970_29095_000049_000000 "I want to be something, to make myself something, to do something.
4970_29095_000049_000001 Why should I rust, and be stupid, and sit in inaction because I am a girl? What would happen to me if thee should lose thy property and die?
4970_29095_000049_000002 What one useful thing could I do for a living, for the support of mother and the children?
4970_29095_000049_000003 And if I had a fortune, would thee want me to lead a useless life?"
4970_29095_000050_000000 "Has thy mother led a useless life?"
4970_29095_000051_000000 "Somewhat that depends upon whether her children amount to anything," retorted the sharp little disputant.
4970_29095_000051_000001 "What's the good, father, of a series of human beings who don't advance any?"
4970_29095_000052_000000 Friend Eli, who had long ago laid aside the Quaker dress, and was out of Meeting, and who in fact after a youth of doubt could not yet define his belief, nevertheless looked with some wonder at this fierce young eagle of his, hatched in a Friend's dove cote.
4970_29095_000052_000001 But he only said,
4970_29095_000053_000000 "Has thee consulted thy mother about a career, I suppose it is a career thee wants?"
4970_29095_000054_000000 ruth did not reply directly; she complained that her mother didn't understand her.
4970_29095_000054_000001 But that wise and placid woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than ruth understood herself.
4970_29095_000054_000002 She also had a history, possibly, and had sometime beaten her young wings against the cage of custom, and indulged in dreams of a new social order, and had passed through that fiery period when it seems possible for one mind, which has not yet tried its limits, to break up and re arrange the world.
4970_29095_000055_000001 Philip liked the letter, as he did everything she did; but he had a dim notion that there was more about herself in the letter than about him.
4970_29095_000055_000002 He took it with him from the Southern Hotel, when he went to walk, and read it over and again in an unfrequented street as he stumbled along.
4970_29095_000055_000003 The rather common place and unformed hand writing seemed to him peculiar and characteristic, different from that of any other woman.
4970_29095_000056_000000 ruth was glad to hear that Philip had made a push into the world, and she was sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him. She should pray for his success at any rate, and especially that the Indians, in saint Louis, would not take his scalp.
4992_23283_000002_000002 Sandford shook his head.
4992_23283_000003_000000 "Miss Milner's health is not good!" said mrs Horton a few minutes after.
4992_23283_000004_000000 Lord Elmwood laid down the newspaper to attend to her.
4992_23283_000006_000000 "So there is to me!" added Sandford, with a sarcastic sneer.
4992_23283_000010_000000 "I think, Miss Woodley, Miss Milner was extremely to blame, though I did not chuse to tell her so before mr Sandford, in giving Lord Frederick an opportunity of speaking to her, unless she means that he shall renew his addresses."
4992_23283_000012_000000 "I am glad to hear it," he returned quickly; "for although I am not of a suspicious nature, yet in regard to her affections for him, I cannot but still have my doubts."
4992_23283_000019_000000 "Perhaps I am mistaken," answered she.
4992_23283_000023_000002 Yet I cannot but lament that I am not as well informed as you are.
4992_23283_000023_000003 I wish to prove my friendship to Miss Milner, but she will not suffer me-and every step that I take for her happiness, I take in the most perplexing uncertainty."
4992_23283_000025_000001 I am not only proper from character, but from circumstances, to be relied upon-my interest is so nearly connected with the interest, and my happiness with the happiness of my ward, that those principles, as well as my honour, would protect her against every peril arising from my being trusted."
4992_23283_000027_000000 "Why so?" said he, warmly.
4992_23283_000031_000000 "Great as my friendship is, there are certainly bounds to it-bounds that shall save her in spite of herself:"--and he raised his voice.
4992_23283_000033_000000 "My Lord, Miss Milner's taste is not a depraved one; it is but too refined."
4992_23283_000034_000000 "What can you mean by that, Miss Woodley?
4992_23283_000034_000001 You talk mysteriously.
4992_23283_000034_000002 Is she not afraid that I will thwart her inclinations?"
4992_23283_000036_000000 "Then must the person be unworthy of her."
4992_23283_000039_000003 Again he searched his own thoughts; nor ineffectually as before.
4992_23283_000040_000000 The rapid emotion of varying passions, which immediately darted over his features, informed Miss Woodley that her secret was discovered-she hid her face, while the tears that fell down to her bosom, confirmed the truth of his suggestion, beyond what oaths could have done.
4992_23283_000041_000000 "For God's sake take care what you are doing-you are destroying my prospects of futurity-you are making this world too dear to me."
4992_23283_000042_000001 Miss Woodley was too little versed in the subject, to know, this would have been not to love at all; at least, not to the extent of breaking through engagements, and all the various obstacles that still militated against their union.
4992_23283_000043_000000 Lord Elmwood was sensible of the embarrassment his presence gave Miss Woodley, and understood the reproaches which she seemed to vent upon herself in silence.
4992_23283_000043_000001 To relieve her from both, he laid his hand with force upon his heart, and said, "Do you believe me?"
4992_23283_000045_000000 "I will make no unjust use of what I know," he replied with firmness.
4992_23283_000047_000000 "But for what my passions now dictate," continued he, "I will not answer.
4992_23283_000047_000001 They are confused-they are triumphant at present.
4992_23283_000047_000002 I have never yet, however, been vanquished by them; and even upon this occasion, my reason shall combat them to the last-and my reason shall fail me, before I do wrong."
4992_23283_000048_000000 He was going to leave the room-she followed him, and cried, "But, my Lord, how shall I see again the unhappy object of my treachery?"
4992_23283_000050_000000 "But she would account it an injury."
4992_23283_000051_000000 "We are not judges of what belongs to ourselves," he replied-"I am transported at the tidings you have revealed, and yet, perhaps, I had better never have heard them."
4992_23283_000052_000000 Miss Woodley was going to say something farther, but as if incapable of attending to her, he hastened out of the room.
4992_41797_000002_000000 eighteen
4992_41797_000004_000000 The Carey children had only found it by accident.
4992_41797_000004_000002 One afternoon Nancy and Kathleen had walked up the road in search of pastures new, and had spied down in a distant hollow a gloomy grey house almost surrounded by cedars.
4992_41797_000004_000003 A grove of poplars to the left of it only made the prospect more depressing, and if it had not been for a great sheet of water near by, floating with cow lilies and pond lilies, the whole aspect of the place would have been unspeakably dreary.
4992_41797_000006_000000 "You won't never see nothin' of 'em," said mr Popham.
4992_41797_000007_000000 "Is the mother dead?" mrs Carey asked.
4992_41797_000008_000001 It's an awful queer world!
4992_41797_000008_000002 Not that I could make a better one!
4992_41797_000009_000000 "Doctor of what?" asked mrs Carey.
4992_41797_000010_000000 "Blamed if I know!
4992_41797_000010_000001 I wouldn't trust him to doctor a sick cat."
4992_41797_000011_000000 "People don't have to be doctors of medicine," interrupted Gilbert. "Grandfather was Alexander Carey, l l.D.,--Doctor of Laws, that is."
4992_41797_000012_000000 mr Popham laid down his brush.
4992_41797_000012_000002 "If you don't work hard you can't keep up with the times!
4992_41797_000013_000000 "What has he done to make him so unpopular?" queried mrs Carey.
4992_41797_000014_000000 "Done?
4992_41797_000014_000002 He keeps the thou shalt not commandments first rate, Hen Lord does!
4992_41797_000014_000003 He neglected his wife and froze her blood and frightened her to death, poor little shadder!
4992_41797_000015_000000 mr Popham exaggerated nothing, but on the contrary left much unsaid in his narrative of the family at the House of Lords.
4992_41797_000015_000001 Henry Lord, with the degree of p h d to his credit, had been Professor of Zoology at a New England college, but had resigned his post in order to write a series of scientific text books.
4992_41797_000015_000002 Always irritable, cold, indifferent, he had grown rapidly more so as years went on.
4992_41797_000015_000004 Then the poor little shadow of a woman dropped wearily into her grave, and a certain elderly mrs Bangs, with grey hair and firm chin, came to keep house and do the work.
4992_41797_000016_000000 A lonelier creature than Olive Lord at sixteen could hardly be imagined. She was a tiny thing for her years, with a little white oval face and peaked chin, pronounced eyebrows, beautifully arched, and a mass of tangled, untidy dark hair.
4992_41797_000016_000001 Her only interests in life were her younger brother Cyril, delicate and timid, and in continual terror of his father,--and a passion for drawing and sketching that was fairly devouring in its intensity.
4992_41797_000016_000003 Whatever appealed to her sense of beauty was straightway transferred to paper or canvas.
4992_41797_000016_000004 Then for the three years before her mother's death there had been surreptitious lessons from a Portland teacher, paid for out of mr Lord's house allowance; for one of his chief faults was an incredible parsimony, amounting almost to miserliness.
4992_41797_000017_000001 "She is wild to know how to do things.
4992_41797_000017_000002 She makes effort after effort, trembling with eagerness, and when she fails to reproduce what she sees, she works herself into a frenzy of grief and disappointment."
4992_41797_000018_000000 "You'd better give her lessons in self control," mr Lord answered. "They are cheaper than instruction in drawing, and much more practical."
4992_41797_000019_000001 She worked, discovering laws and making rules for herself, since she had no helpers. When she could not make a rabbit or a bird look "real" on paper, she searched in her father's books for pictures of its bones.
4992_41797_000019_000003 O! Cyril, there must be some better way of doing; I just draw the outline of an animal and then I put hairs or feathers on it.
4992_41797_000019_000004 They have no bodies.
4992_41797_000019_000005 They couldn't run nor move; they're just pasteboard."
4992_41797_000020_000000 "Why don't you do flowers and houses, Olive?" inquired Cyril solicitously.
4992_41797_000020_000001 "And people paint fruit, and dead fish on platters, and pitchers of lemonade with ice in,--why don't you try things like those?"
4992_41797_000021_000000 "I suppose they're easier," Olive returned with a sigh, "but who could bear to do them when there are living, breathing, moving things; things that puzzle you by looking different every minute?
4992_41797_000023_000001 Her gloomy young heart was visited by frequent storms and she looked as unlovable as she was unloved.
4992_41797_000023_000002 But Nancy Carey, never shy, and as eager to give herself as people always are who are born and bred in joy and love, Nancy hopped out of Mother Carey's warm nest one day, and fixing her bright eyes and sunny, hopeful glance on the lonely, frowning little neighbor, stretched out her hand in friendship.
4992_41797_000023_000004 Her hand, so marvellously full of skill, had never held another's, and she was desperately self conscious; but magnetism flowed from Nancy as electric currents from a battery.
4992_41797_000024_000000 The first interview, purely a casual one, took place on the edge of the lily pond where Olive was sketching frogs, and where Nancy went for cat o'-nine tails.
4992_41797_000024_000001 It proved to be a long and intimate talk, and when mrs Carey looked out of her bedroom window just before supper she saw, at the pasture bars, the two girls with their arms round each other and their cheeks close together.
4992_41797_000024_000002 Nancy's curly chestnut crop shone in the sun, and Olive's thick black plaits looked blacker by contrast.
4992_41797_000025_000000 A few moments later Nancy entered her mother's room, her arms filled with treasures from the woods and fields.
4992_41797_000025_000003 She's wonderful!
4992_41797_000025_000005 She's older than I am, but so tiny and sad and shy that she seems like a child.
4992_41797_000025_000006 Oh, mother, there's always so much spare room in your heart,--for you took in Julia and yet we never felt the difference,--won't you make a place for Olive?
4992_41797_000025_000007 There never was anybody needed you so much as she does,--never."
4992_41797_000026_000000 Have you ever lifted a stone and seen the pale, yellow, stunted shoots of grass under it?
4992_41806_000001_000000 THE CAREY HOUSEWARMING
4992_41806_000002_000000 The housewarming was at its height, and everybody agreed once in every ten minutes that it was probably the most beautiful party that had ever happened in the history of the world.
4992_41806_000003_000000 Water flowed freely through Cousin Ann's expensive pipes, that had been buried so deep in their trenches that the winter frosts could not affect them.
4992_41806_000003_000001 Natty Harmon tried the kitchen pump secretly several times during the evening, for the water had to run up hill all the way from the well to the kitchen sink, and he believed this to be a continual miracle that might "give out" at any moment.
4992_41806_000003_000002 The stove in the cellar, always alluded to by Gilbert as the "young furnace," had not yet been used, save by way of experiment, but it was believed to be a perfect success.
4992_41806_000003_000003 To night there was no need of extra heat, and there were great ceremonies to be observed in lighting the fires on the hearthstones.
4992_41806_000003_000004 They began with the one in the family sitting room; Colonel Wheeler, Ralph Thurston, mr and mrs Bill Harmon with Natty and Rufus, mr and mrs Popham with Digby and Lallie Joy, all standing in admiring groups and thrilling with delight at the order of events.
4992_41806_000007_000000 Mother Carey spoke these words so simply and naturally, as she looked towards her neighbors one after another, with her hand resting on Peter's curly head, that they hardly knew whether to keep quiet or say Amen.
4992_41806_000008_000000 "Was that the Bible, Osh?" whispered Bill Harmon.
4992_41806_000009_000000 "Don't know; 'most everything she says sounds like the Bible or Shakespeare to me."
4992_41806_000010_000001 Then Nancy handed peter a loosely bound sheaf, saying: "To light this fire I give you a torch.
4992_41806_000010_000002 In it are herbs of the field for health of the body, a fern leaf for grace, a sprig of elm for peace, one of oak for strength, with evergreen to show that we live forever in the deeds we have done.
4992_41806_000011_000000 peter crouched on the hearth and lighted the fire in three places, then handed the torch to Kathleen as he crept again into his mother's lap, awed into complete silence by the influence of his own mystic rite. Kathleen waved the torch to and fro as she recited some beautiful lines written for some such purpose as that which called them together to night.
4992_41806_000014_000000 Next came Olive's turn to help in the ceremonies.
4992_41806_000014_000002 Olive had painted the motto on a long narrow panel of canvas, and, giving it to mr Popham, stood by the fireside while he deftly fitted it into the place prepared for it. The family had feared that he would tell a good story when he found himself the centre of attraction, but he was as dumb as peter, and for the same reason.
4992_41806_000017_000000 Gilbert, at the head of the procession, held Mother Hamilton's picture, which had been taken from the old brick oven where "my son Tom" had hidden it.
4992_41806_000017_000001 Mother Carey's bedroom, with its bouquets of field flowers on the wall paper, was gaily lighted and ready to receive the gift.
4992_41806_000017_000003 Underneath it we lay a posy of pressed daisies, buttercups, and Queen Anne's lace, the wild flowers she loved best."
4992_41806_000020_000001 Thou who settest the solitary in families, bless the life that is sheltered here.
4992_41806_000020_000002 Grant that trust and peace and comfort may abide within, and that love and light and usefulness may go out from this house forever.
4992_41806_000022_000000 "Ain't they the greatest?" murmured Lallie Joy, turning to her father, but he had disappeared from the group.
4992_41806_000023_000001 Mother Carey poured coffee, Nancy chocolate, and the others helped serve the sandwiches and cake, doughnuts and tarts.
4992_41806_000024_000001 "We cannot be happy without mr Popham."
4992_41806_000025_000001 Approaching the dining table, he carefully placed the article in the centre and removed the cloth.
4992_41806_000026_000000 It was the Dirty Boy, carefully mended!
4992_41806_000027_000000 The guests naturally had no associations with the Carey Curse, and the Careys themselves were dumb with amazement and despair.
4992_41806_000028_000000 "I've seen this thing layin' in the barn chamber in a thousand pieces all summer!" explained mr Popham radiantly.
4992_41806_000029_000000 "Thank you, mr Popham!" said mrs Carey, her eyes twinkling as she looked at the laughing children.
4992_41806_000029_000001 "It was kind of you to spend so much time in our behalf."
4992_41806_000032_000000 It was as cheery, gay, festive, neighborly, and friendly a supper as ever took place in the dining room of the Yellow House, although Governor Weatherby may have had some handsomer banquets in his time. When it was over all made their way into the rosy, bowery, summer parlor.
4992_41806_000032_000001 Soon another fire sparkled and snapped on the hearth, and there were songs and poems and choruses and Osh Popham's fiddle, to say nothing of the supreme event of the evening, his rendition of "Fly like a youthful hart or roe, over the hills where spices grow," to Mother Carey's accompaniment.
4992_41806_000032_000002 He always slipped up his glasses during this performance and closed his eyes, but neither grey hairs nor "specs" could dim the radiant smile that made him seem about fifteen years old and the junior of both his children.
4992_41806_000034_000000 Last of all the entire company gathered round the old-fashioned piano for a parting hymn.
4992_41806_000034_000001 The face of the mahogany shone with delight, and why not, when it was doing everything (almost everything!) within the scope of a piano, and yet the family had enjoyed weeks of good nourishing meals on what had been saved by its exertions.
4992_41806_000034_000003 The tall silver candle sticks gleamed in the firelight, the silver dish of polished Baldwins blushed rosier in the glow.
4992_41806_000034_000004 Mother Carey played the dear old common metre tune, and the voices rang out in Whittier's hymn.
4992_41806_000034_000005 The Careys all sang like thrushes, and even peter, holding his hymn book upside down, put in little bird notes, always on the key, whenever he caught a familiar strain.
4992_41806_000035_000000 "Once more the liberal year laughs out O'er richer stores than gems or gold; Once more, with harvest song and shout Is Nature's bloodless triumph told."
4992_41806_000036_000000 "We shut our eyes, the flowers bloom on; We murmur, but the corn ears fill; We choose the shadow, but the sun That casts it shines behind us still."
5105_28233_000001_000000 CHAPTER two.
5105_28233_000010_000000 Hector Servadac was thirty years of age, an orphan without lineage and almost without means.
5105_28233_000010_000001 Thirsting for glory rather than for gold, slightly scatter brained, but warm hearted, generous, and brave, he was eminently formed to be the protege of the god of battles.
5105_28233_000013_000002 They came to a place where the side work of the trench had been so riddled by shell that a portion of it had actually fallen in, leaving an aperture quite unsheltered from the grape shot that was pouring in thick and fast.
5105_28233_000013_000003 The men hesitated.
5105_28233_000013_000004 In an instant Servadac mounted the side work, laid himself down in the gap, and thus filling up the breach by his own body, shouted, "March on!"
5105_28233_000014_000000 And through a storm of shot, not one of which touched the prostrate officer, the troop passed in safety.
5105_28233_000016_000001 She was a colonel's widow, young and handsome, very reserved, not to say haughty in her manner, and either indifferent or impervious to the admiration which she inspired. Captain Servadac had not yet ventured to declare his attachment; of rivals he was well aware he had not a few, and amongst these not the least formidable was the Russian Count Timascheff.
5105_28233_000017_000001 Ben Zoof was devoted, body and soul, to his superior officer.
5105_28233_000018_000002 To crown all, Montmartre boasted a mountain-a veritable mountain; envious tongues indeed might pronounce it little more than a hill; but Ben Zoof would have allowed himself to be hewn in pieces rather than admit that it was anything less than fifteen thousand feet in height.
5105_28233_000019_000001 Ben Zoof, however, did not despair of ultimately converting the captain, and meanwhile had resolved never to leave him.
5105_28233_000019_000002 When a private in the eighth Cavalry, he had been on the point of quitting the army at twenty eight years of age, but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to Captain Servadac.
5105_28233_000019_000003 Side by side they fought in two campaigns.
5105_28233_000019_000004 Servadac had saved Ben Zoof's life in Japan; Ben Zoof had rendered his master a like service in the Soudan.
5105_28233_000019_000005 The bond of union thus effected could never be severed; and although Ben Zoof's achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement, he firmly declined all honors or any pension that might part him from his superior officer.
5105_28233_000022_000000 Ben Zoof's eyes glistened with delight; and from that moment Hector Servadac and Montmartre held equal places in his affection.
5105_28240_000003_000000 CHAPTER nine.
5105_28240_000013_000002 After rounding the peak, she steered direct for the channel to which Servadac by his gestures was pointing her, and was not long in entering the creek.
5105_28240_000013_000005 Captain Servadac hastened towards him.
5105_28240_000017_000000 "I am quite aware of it.
5105_28240_000024_000005 Was he aware, in short, that the entire motions of the terrestrial sphere had undergone a complete modification? To all these inquiries, the count responded in the affirmative.
5105_28240_000030_000000 The count shook his head.
5105_28240_000031_000000 "I am not sure," said he, "but what the tour of the Mediterranean will prove to be the tour of the world."
5105_28241_000002_000000 CHAPTER ten A SEARCH FOR ALGERIA
5105_28241_000003_000001 Her sea going qualities were excellent, and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe.
5105_28241_000003_000002 Count Timascheff was himself no sailor, but had the greatest confidence in leaving the command of his yacht in the hands of Lieutenant Procope, a man of about thirty years of age, and an excellent seaman.
5105_28241_000003_000004 After an apprenticeship on a merchant ship he had entered the imperial navy, and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht, in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time, throughout the winter generally cruising in the Mediterranean, whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters.
5105_28241_000004_000000 The ship could not have been in better hands.
5105_28241_000004_000001 The lieutenant was well informed in many matters outside the pale of his profession, and his attainments were alike creditable to himself and to the liberal friend who had given him his education.
5105_28241_000004_000004 The late astounding events, however, had rendered Procope manifestly uneasy, and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety.
5105_28241_000005_000000 Steam up and canvas spread, the schooner started eastwards.
5105_28241_000005_000001 With a favorable wind she would certainly have made eleven knots an hour had not the high waves somewhat impeded her progress.
5105_28241_000005_000002 Although only a moderate breeze was blowing, the sea was rough, a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earth's attraction rendering the liquid particles so buoyant, that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented.
5105_28241_000005_000004 Nor did these waves in the usual way partially unfurl themselves and rebound against the sides of the vessel; they might rather be described as long undulations carrying the schooner (its weight diminished from the same cause as that of the water) alternately to such heights and depths, that if Captain Servadac had been subject to seasickness he must have found himself in sorry plight.
5105_28241_000006_000000 For a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of Algeria; but no land appeared to the south.
5105_28241_000007_000000 Happily the recent phenomena had no effect upon the compass; the magnetic needle, which in these regions had pointed about twenty two degrees from the north pole, had never deviated in the least-a proof that, although east and west had apparently changed places, north and south continued to retain their normal position as cardinal points.
5105_28241_000008_000000 On the first morning of the cruise Lieutenant Procope, who, like most Russians, spoke French fluently, was explaining these peculiarities to Captain Servadac; the count was present, and the conversation perpetually recurred, as naturally it would, to the phenomena which remained so inexplicable to them all.
5105_28241_000009_000000 "It is very evident," said the lieutenant, "that ever since the first of January the earth has been moving in a new orbit, and from some unknown cause has drawn nearer to the sun"
5105_28241_000010_000000 "No doubt about that," said Servadac; "and I suppose that, having crossed the orbit of Venus, we have a good chance of running into the orbit of Mercury."
5105_28241_000011_000000 "And finish up by a collision with the sun!" added the count.
5105_28241_000012_000000 "There is no fear of that, sir.
5105_28241_000012_000001 The earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit, but she is not incurring any probable risk of being precipitated onto the sun"
5105_28241_000013_000000 "Can you satisfy us of that?" asked the count.
5105_28241_000014_000000 "I can, sir.
5105_28241_000014_000001 I can give you a proof which I think you will own is conclusive.
5105_28241_000015_000000 "And what demonstration do you offer," asked Servadac eagerly, "that it will not happen?"
5105_28241_000016_000000 "Simply this, captain: that since the earth entered her new orbit half the sixty four days has already elapsed, and yet it is only just recently that she has crossed the orbit of Venus, hardly one third of the distance to be traversed to reach the sun"
5105_28241_000017_000000 The lieutenant paused to allow time for reflection, and added: "Moreover, I have every reason to believe that we are not so near the sun as we have been.
5105_28241_000017_000002 At the same time, we have the problem still unsolved that the Mediterranean has evidently been transported to the equatorial zone."
5105_28241_000018_000000 Both the count and the captain expressed themselves reassured by his representations, and observed that they must now do all in their power to discover what had become of the vast continent of Africa, of which, they were hitherto failing so completely to find a vestige.
5105_28241_000019_000004 But Algiers, like all the other coast towns, had apparently been absorbed into the bowels of the earth.
5105_28241_000020_000000 Captain Servadac, with clenched teeth and knitted brow, stood sternly, almost fiercely, regarding the boundless waste of water.
5105_28241_000020_000001 His pulse beat fast as he recalled the friends and comrades with whom he had spent the last few years in that vanished city.
5105_28241_000020_000002 All the images of his past life floated upon his memory; his thoughts sped away to his native France, only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the Algerian metropolis.
5105_28241_000021_000000 "Is it not impossible," he murmured aloud, "that any city should disappear so completely?
5105_28241_000021_000001 Would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible?
5105_28241_000021_000002 Surely some portion of the Casbah must still rise above the waves?
5105_28241_000021_000003 The imperial fort, too, was built upon an elevation of seven hundred fifty feet; it is incredible that it should be so totally submerged. Unless some vestiges of these are found, I shall begin to suspect that the whole of Africa has been swallowed in some vast abyss."
5105_28241_000022_000000 Another circumstance was most remarkable.
5105_28241_000022_000001 Not a material object of any kind was to be noticed floating on the surface of the water; not one branch of a tree had been seen drifting by, nor one spar belonging to one of the numerous vessels that a month previously had been moored in the magnificent bay which stretched twelve miles across from Cape Matafuz to Point Pexade.
5105_28241_000022_000002 Perhaps the depths might disclose what the surface failed to reveal, and Count Timascheff, anxious that Servadac should have every facility afforded him for solving his doubts, called for the sounding line.
5105_28241_000024_000000 "You must see, lieutenant, I should think, that we are not so near the coast of Algeria as you imagined."
5105_28241_000025_000000 The lieutenant shook his head.
5105_28241_000025_000001 After pondering awhile, he said: "If we were farther away I should expect to find a depth of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fathoms.
5105_28241_000025_000002 Five fathoms!
5105_28241_000025_000003 I confess I am puzzled."
5105_28241_000026_000000 For the next thirty six hours, until the fourth of February, the sea was examined and explored with the most unflagging perseverance.
5105_28241_000026_000001 Its depth remained invariable, still four, or at most five, fathoms; and although its bottom was assiduously dredged, it was only to prove it barren of marine production of any type.
5105_28241_000027_000002 Nothing was to be done but to put about, and return in disappointment towards the north.
5142_33396_000000_000001 Have you always been a thrall?"
5142_33396_000001_000000 The thrall's eyes flashed.
5142_33396_000002_000001 There, far off, is my country, across the water.
5142_33396_000002_000003 Two hundred warriors feasted in his hall and followed him to battle.
5142_33396_000002_000004 Ten sons sat at meat with him, and I was the youngest.
5142_33396_000003_000002 The eldest of you shall have my farm when I die.
5142_33396_000003_000003 The rest of you, off a viking!'
5142_33396_000004_000000 "He had three ships.
5142_33396_000004_000001 These he gave to three of my brothers.
5142_33396_000004_000002 But I stayed that spring and built me a boat.
5142_33396_000004_000004 At the prow I carved the head with open mouth and forked tongue thrust out.
5142_33396_000005_000000 "'There, stand so!' I said, 'and glare and hiss at my foes.'
5142_33396_000006_000001 There I put the pilot's seat and a strong tiller for the rudder.
5142_33396_000006_000002 On the breast and sides I carved the dragon's scales.
5142_33396_000007_000000 "The night that it was finished I went to my father's feast.
5142_33396_000008_000000 "'This is my vow: I will sail to Norway and I will harry the coast and fill my boat with riches.
5142_33396_000008_000001 Then I will get me a farm and will winter in that land.
5142_33396_000008_000002 Now who will follow me?'
5142_33396_000010_000000 "But others jumped to their feet with their mead horns in their hands. Thirty men, one after another, raised their horns and said:
5142_33396_000012_000000 "On the next morning we got into my dragon and started.
5142_33396_000012_000001 I sat high in the pilot's seat.
5142_33396_000012_000002 As our boat flashed down the rollers into the water I made this song and sang it:
5142_33396_000014_000000 "So we harried the coast of Norway.
5142_33396_000014_000001 We ate at many men's tables uninvited.
5142_33396_000014_000002 Many men we found overburdened with gold.
5142_33396_000015_000000 "'My dragon's belly is never full,' and on board went the gold.
5142_33396_000016_000000 "Oh! it is better to live on the sea and let other men raise your crops and cook your meals.
5142_33396_000017_000000 "Up and down the water we went to get much wealth and much frolic.
5142_33396_000017_000001 After a while my men said:
5142_33396_000018_000000 "'What of the farm, Olaf?'
5142_33396_000019_000000 "'Not yet,' I answered.
5142_33396_000019_000001 'Viking is better for summer.
5142_33396_000021_000000 "'Now for the farm.
5142_33396_000022_000000 "So we set off for it.
5142_33396_000022_000003 There was but one door to the house.
5142_33396_000022_000004 We went to it, and I struck it with my spear.
5142_33396_000024_000000 "'Hello!
5142_33396_000024_000002 Hello!' I shouted, and my men made a great din.
5142_33396_000025_000000 "At last some one from inside said:
5142_33396_000026_000000 "'Who calls?'
5142_33396_000027_000000 "'I call,' I answered.
5142_33396_000028_000000 "The door opened only a little, but I pushed it wide and leaped into the room.
5142_33396_000028_000001 It was so dark that I could see nothing but a few sparks on the hearth.
5142_33396_000028_000002 I stood with my back to the wall; for I wanted no sword reaching out of the dark for me.
5142_33396_000029_000000 "'Now start up the fire,' I said.
5142_33396_000030_000000 "'Come, come!' I called, when no one obeyed.
5142_33396_000030_000001 'A fire!
5142_33396_000032_000000 "'Yes, a stingy host!
5142_33396_000033_000002 There were benches for twenty men along each side.
5142_33396_000033_000003 The farmer crouched by the fire, afraid to move.
5142_33396_000033_000004 On a bench in a far corner were a dozen people huddled together.
5142_33396_000034_000000 "'Ho, thralls!' I called to them.
5142_33396_000034_000001 'Bring in the table.
5142_33396_000034_000002 We are hungry.'
5142_33396_000035_000000 "Off they ran through a door at the back of the hall.
5142_33396_000036_000000 "'Well, friend farmer,' laughed one, 'why such a long face?
5142_33396_000036_000001 Do you not think we shall be merry company?'
5142_33396_000037_000001 'What man wants to spend the winter with no guests?'
5142_33396_000038_000000 "'Ah!' another then cried out, sitting up.
5142_33396_000038_000001 'Here comes something that will be a welcome guest to my stomach.'
5142_33396_000039_000000 "The thralls were bringing in a great pot of meat.
5142_33396_000039_000001 They set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it, and we sat and watched it boil while we joked.
5142_33396_000039_000002 At last the supper began.
5142_33396_000039_000003 The farmer sat gloomily on the bench and would not eat, and you cannot wonder; for he saw us putting potfuls of his good beef and basket loads of bread into our big mouths. When the tables were taken out and the mead horns came round, I stood up and raised my horn and said to the farmer:
5142_33396_000040_000000 "'You would not eat with us.
5142_33396_000040_000002 I drink this to your health.'
5142_33396_000041_000001 He took it and smiled, saying:
5142_33396_000042_000000 "'Since it is to my health, I will drink it.
5142_33396_000042_000001 I thought that all this night's work would be my death.'
5142_33396_000044_000001 At last I stood up and said:
5142_33396_000045_000000 "'I like this little taste of your hospitality, friend farmer.
5142_33396_000046_000000 "My men roared with laughter.
5142_33396_000047_000000 "'Come,' they cried, 'thank him for that, farmer.
5142_33396_000047_000001 Did you ever have such a lordly guest before?'
5142_33396_000048_000000 "I went on:
5142_33396_000049_000001 So I will give out this law: that my men shall never leave you alone.
5142_33396_000049_000003 He shall not leave you day or night, whether you are working or playing or sleeping.
5142_33396_000049_000004 Leif and Grim shall be the same kind of friends to your two sons.'
5142_33396_000050_000000 "I named nine others and said:
5142_33396_000051_000000 "'And these shall follow your thralls in the same way.
5142_33396_000052_000000 "So I set guards over every one in that house.
5142_33396_000052_000002 So no tales got out to the neighbors.
5142_33396_000052_000003 Besides, it was a lonely place, and by good luck no one came that way.
5142_33396_000053_000000 "Well, after we had been there for a long time, Hakon came in to the feast one night and said:
5142_33396_000054_000000 "'I heard a cuckoo to day!'
5142_33396_000056_000000 "All my men put their hands to their mouths and shouted.
5142_33396_000056_000001 Their eyes danced.
5142_36377_000000_000003 She was a melancholy, middle aged woman, without visible attractions of any sort-one of those persons who appear to accept the obligation of living under protest, as a burden which they would never have consented to bear if they had only been consulted first.
5142_36377_000002_000001 I followed the groom up to my room, not over well pleased with my first experience of the farm.
5142_36377_000004_000000 My room was clean-oppressively clean.
5142_36377_000004_000002 My library was limited to the Bible and the Prayer Book.
5142_36377_000004_000006 My spirits sank as I looked round me.
5142_36377_000004_000012 I looked at my watch.
5142_36377_000006_000000 mr Meadowcroft's invalid chair had been wheeled to the head of the table.
5142_36377_000006_000001 On his right-hand side sat his sad and silent daughter.
5142_36377_000006_000005 But there was no marked character in either face.
5142_36377_000006_000006 I set them down as men with undeveloped qualities, waiting (the good and evil qualities alike) for time and circumstances to bring them to their full growth.
5142_36377_000008_000000 He was short, spare, and wiry; singularly pale for a person whose life was passed in the country.
5142_36377_000008_000001 The face was in other respects, besides this, a striking face to see.
5142_36377_000008_000005 "A little cracked"--that in the popular phrase was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the supper room.
5142_36377_000010_000002 He is not well; he has come over the ocean for rest, and change of scene.
5142_36377_000010_000004 I hope you have no prejudice against Americans.
5142_36377_000010_000006 They pointedly drew back from john Jago as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table.
5142_36377_000011_000000 The door opened once more.
5142_36377_000011_000001 A young lady quietly joined the party at the supper table.
5142_36377_000012_000000 Was the young lady Naomi Colebrook?
5142_36377_000012_000002 Naomi Colebrook at last!
5142_36377_000013_000000 A pretty girl, and, so far as I could judge by appearances, a good girl too.
5142_36377_000013_000001 Describing her generally, I may say that she had a small head, well carried, and well set on her shoulders; bright gray eyes, that looked at you honestly, and meant what they looked; a trim, slight little figure-too slight for our English notions of beauty; a strong American accent; and (a rare thing in America) a pleasantly toned voice, which made the accent agreeable to English ears.
5142_36377_000013_000002 Our first impressions of people are, in nine cases out of ten, the right impressions.
5142_36377_000013_000003 I liked Naomi Colebrook at first sight; liked her pleasant smile; liked her hearty shake of the hand when we were presented to each other.
5142_36377_000014_000000 For once in a way, I proved a true prophet.
5142_36377_000014_000003 She changed color for a moment, and looked at him, with a pretty, reluctant tenderness, as she took her chair.
5142_36377_000015_000000 The supper was not a merry one.
5142_36377_000016_000001 He looked up at Naomi doubtingly from his plate, and looked down again slowly with a frown. When I addressed him, he answered constrainedly.
5142_36377_000016_000002 Even when he spoke to mr Meadowcroft, he was still on his guard-on his guard against the two young men, as I fancied by the direction which his eyes took on these occasions.
5142_36377_000016_000003 When we began our meal, I had noticed for the first time that Silas Meadowcroft's left hand was strapped up with surgical plaster; and I now further observed that john Jago's wandering brown eyes, furtively looking at everybody round the table in turn, looked with a curious, cynical scrutiny at the young man's injured hand.
5142_36377_000017_000002 When the two sons seized a stray remark of mine about animals in general, and applied it satirically to the mismanagement of sheep and oxen in particular, they looked at john Jago, while they talked to me.
5142_36377_000017_000005 A more dreary and more disunited family party I never sat at the table with.
5142_36377_000019_000001 I wish you good night."
5142_36586_000008_000004 Gould endeavoured to ascertain the nature of the influences which thus act on stature; but he arrived only at negative results, namely that they did not relate to climate, the elevation of the land, soil, nor even "in any controlling degree" to the abundance or the need of the comforts of life.
5142_36586_000008_000012 dr Beddoe has lately proved that, with the inhabitants of Britain, residence in towns and certain occupations have a deteriorating influence on height; and he infers that the result is to a certain extent inherited, as is likewise the case in the United States.
5142_36586_000009_000000 Whether external conditions produce any other direct effect on man is not known.
5142_36586_000009_000003 But this subject will be more properly discussed when we treat of the different races of mankind.
5142_36586_000010_000000 EFFECTS OF THE INCREASED USE AND DISUSE OF PARTS.
5142_36586_000011_000000 It is well known that use strengthens the muscles in the individual, and complete disuse, or the destruction of the proper nerve, weakens them. When the eye is destroyed, the optic nerve often becomes atrophied.
5142_36586_000011_000001 When an artery is tied, the lateral channels increase not only in diameter, but in the thickness and strength of their coats.
5142_36586_000011_000002 When one kidney ceases to act from disease, the other increases in size, and does double work.
5142_36600_000001_000000 CHAPTER seven.
5142_36600_000004_000004 Even a slight degree of sterility between any two forms when first crossed, or in their offspring, is generally considered as a decisive test of their specific distinctness; and their continued persistence without blending within the same area, is usually accepted as sufficient evidence, either of some degree of mutual sterility, or in the case of animals of some mutual repugnance to pairing.
5142_36600_000005_000001 Geographical distribution is often brought into play unconsciously and sometimes consciously; so that forms living in two widely separated areas, in which most of the other inhabitants are specifically distinct, are themselves usually looked at as distinct; but in truth this affords no aid in distinguishing geographical races from so-called good or true species.
5142_36600_000006_000000 Now let us apply these generally admitted principles to the races of man, viewing him in the same spirit as a naturalist would any other animal.
5142_36600_000006_000004 Father Ripa makes exactly the same remark with respect to the Chinese.); and the Hindoo cannot at first perceive any difference between the several European nations.
5142_36600_000006_000007 Nevertheless, these men, if seen alive, would undoubtedly appear very distinct, so that we are clearly much influenced in our judgment by the mere colour of the skin and hair, by slight differences in the features, and by expression.
5142_36600_000007_000007 The races differ also in constitution, in acclimatisation and in liability to certain diseases.
5142_36600_000007_000008 Their mental characteristics are likewise very distinct; chiefly as it would appear in their emotional, but partly in their intellectual faculties.
5142_36600_000008_000007 Even some of the most strongly marked races cannot be identified with that degree of unanimity which might have been expected from what has been written on the subject.
5142_36600_000008_000014 They give also corroborative evidence; but c Vogt thinks that the subject requires further investigation.), that the human skulls found in the caves of Brazil, entombed with many extinct mammals, belonged to the same type as that now prevailing throughout the American Continent.
5142_36600_000009_000000 Our naturalist would then perhaps turn to geographical distribution, and he would probably declare that those forms must be distinct species, which differ not only in appearance, but are fitted for hot, as well as damp or dry countries, and for the Arctic regions.
5142_36600_000010_000000 In determining whether the supposed varieties of the same kind of domestic animal should be ranked as such, or as specifically distinct, that is, whether any of them are descended from distinct wild species, every naturalist would lay much stress on the fact of their external parasites being specifically distinct.
5142_36600_000010_000001 All the more stress would be laid on this fact, as it would be an exceptional one; for I am informed by mr Denny that the most different kinds of dogs, fowls, and pigeons, in England, are infested by the same species of Pediculi or lice.
5142_36600_000010_000004 In every case in which many specimens were obtained the differences were constant. The surgeon of a whaling ship in the Pacific assured me that when the Pediculi, with which some Sandwich Islanders on board swarmed, strayed on to the bodies of the English sailors, they died in the course of three or four days.
5142_36600_000010_000005 These Pediculi were darker coloured, and appeared different from those proper to the natives of Chiloe in South America, of which he gave me specimens.
5142_36600_000010_000006 These, again, appeared larger and much softer than European lice.
5142_36600_000010_000007 mr Murray procured four kinds from Africa, namely, from the Negroes of the Eastern and Western coasts, from the Hottentots and Kaffirs; two kinds from the natives of Australia; two from North and two from South America.
5142_36600_000010_000008 In these latter cases it may be presumed that the Pediculi came from natives inhabiting different districts.
5142_36600_000011_000000 Our supposed naturalist having proceeded thus far in his investigation, would next enquire whether the races of men, when crossed, were in any degree sterile.
5142_36600_000011_000012 dr Rohlfs writes to me that he found the mixed races in the Great Sahara, derived from Arabs, Berbers, and Negroes of three tribes, extraordinarily fertile.
5142_36600_000012_000001 We know that these qualities are easily affected by changed conditions of life, or by close inter breeding, and that they are governed by highly complex laws, for instance, that of the unequal fertility of converse crosses between the same two species.
5142_36600_000012_000002 With forms which must be ranked as undoubted species, a perfect series exists from those which are absolutely sterile when crossed, to those which are almost or completely fertile.
5142_36600_000012_000003 The degrees of sterility do not coincide strictly with the degrees of difference between the parents in external structure or habits of life.
5142_36600_000012_000013 It is here manifestly impossible to select the more sterile individuals, which have already ceased to yield seeds; so that the acme of sterility, when the germen alone is affected, cannot have been gained through selection.
533_1066_000001_000000 His recovery was destined to be almost as sudden as his disappearance, and was due directly to the tramp Alex had brought to Sunnyside.
533_1066_000003_000001 mr Jamieson called the hospital, while we crowded around him.
533_1066_000004_000002 Out of deference to Liddy they washed their dishes once a day, and they concocted queer messes, according to their several abilities.
533_1066_000004_000003 They had one triumph that they ate regularly for breakfast, and that clung to their clothes and their hair the rest of the day.
533_1066_000004_000004 It was bacon, hardtack and onions, fried together.
533_1066_000006_000000 "Miss Innes," he said, stopping me as I was about to go to my room up stairs, "how are your nerves tonight?"
533_1066_000007_000000 "I have none," I said happily.
533_1066_000008_000000 "I mean," he persisted, "do you feel as though you could go through with something rather unusual?"
533_1066_000009_000000 "The most unusual thing I can think of would be a peaceful night.
533_1066_000009_000001 But if anything is going to occur, don't dare to let me miss it."
533_1066_000010_000000 "Something is going to occur," he said.
533_1066_000010_000002 "Don't ask me any questions, Miss Innes.
533_1066_000012_000000 They were talking confidentially together, but when I came down they ceased.
533_1066_000013_000000 I asked no questions.
533_1066_000014_000001 He carried something over his shoulder which I could not make out.
533_1066_000014_000002 In this way we walked for perhaps twenty minutes.
533_1066_000015_000000 The doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a halt.
533_1066_000015_000002 Between them I caught a glimpse of starlight shining down on rows of white headstones and an occasional more imposing monument, or towering shaft.
533_1066_000015_000003 In spite of myself, I drew my breath in sharply.
533_1066_000015_000004 We were on the edge of the Casanova churchyard.
533_1066_000016_000003 Once, indeed-but mr Jamieson said it was an owl, and I tried to believe him.
533_1066_000018_000000 "It's no place for a woman," I heard him protesting angrily.
533_1066_000020_000002 Thus, there is a sense of desecration, of a reversal of the everlasting fitness of things, in resurrecting a body from its mother clay.
533_1066_000022_000000 "I never expected to come to this," he said once.
533_1066_000022_000001 "There's one thing sure-I'll not be suspected of complicity.
533_1066_000023_000001 There was a period of stress, I think, while the heavy coffin was being raised.
533_1066_000025_000000 "Now, Miss Innes," he said gently.
533_131556_000001_000000 Evening.--Breakfast passed well over: I was calm and cool throughout.
533_131556_000001_000003 Yet why so long for their departure?
533_131556_000001_000005 The word stares me in the face like a guilty confession, but it is true: I hate him-I hate him!
533_131556_000001_000006 But God have mercy on his miserable soul! and make him see and feel his guilt-I ask no other vengeance!
533_131556_000002_000002 I sometimes think I ought to give him credit for the good feeling he simulates so well; and then again, I think it is my duty to suspect him under the peculiar circumstances in which I am placed.
533_131556_000002_000004 I have done well to record them so minutely.
533_131556_000004_000000 'I am too well acquainted with your character and conduct to feel any real friendship for you, and as I am without your talent for dissimulation, I cannot assume the appearance of it.
533_131556_000006_000000 'Annabella will excuse us,' said she; 'she's busy reading.'
533_131556_000008_000000 Her impudence astounded me; but I complied, and followed her into the library.
533_131556_000009_000000 'Who told you this?' said she.
533_131556_000010_000000 'No one: I am not incapable of seeing for myself.'
533_131556_000012_000000 'If I were suspicious,' I replied, 'I should have discovered your infamy long before.
533_131556_000012_000001 No, Lady Lowborough, I do not found my charge upon suspicion.'
533_131556_000015_000000 She coloured again excessively, and remained silent, pressing her finger against her teeth, and gazing into the fire.
533_131556_000017_000000 'Suppose I do?'
533_131556_000022_000000 'I shall not tell him.'
533_131556_000025_000000 'Give me no thanks; it is not for your sake that I refrain.
533_131556_000027_000001 I would not for much that she should know the infamy and disgrace of her relation!'
533_131556_000028_000000 'You use hard words, mrs Huntingdon, but I can pardon you.'
533_131556_000029_000000 'And now, Lady Lowborough,' continued I, 'let me counsel you to leave this house as soon as possible.
533_131556_000030_000000 'Yes, yes, of course,' said she, interrupting me with a gesture of impatience.
533_131556_000030_000001 'But I cannot go, Helen, before the time appointed for our departure.
533_131562_000001_000000 CHAPTER forty
533_131562_000002_000003 Unluckily for me, he was more sober that night than he usually is at such an hour.
533_131562_000005_000000 'What keys?'
533_131562_000010_000000 'And I know, too,' said he, suddenly seizing my closed hand and rudely abstracting them from it.
533_131562_000010_000001 He then took up one of the candles and relighted it by thrusting it into the fire.
533_131562_000011_000000 'Now, then,' sneered he, 'we must have a confiscation of property.
533_131562_000012_000000 And putting the keys into his pocket, he walked into the library.
533_131562_000012_000004 He then rang the bell.
533_131562_000018_000000 mr Huntingdon then went up stairs.
533_131562_000020_000000 'Benson, your mistress has broken the candle; bring another.'
533_131562_000022_000000 'I didn't say I'd broken it, did I?' returned he.
533_131562_000023_000000 'What great discovery have you made now, mr Huntingdon?
533_131562_000024_000000 'Not in money matters, exactly, it seems; but it's best to keep out of the way of temptation.'
533_131562_000026_000000 'And so,' said he at length, 'you thought to disgrace me, did you, by running away and turning artist, and supporting yourself by the labour of your hands, forsooth?
533_131562_000026_000001 And you thought to rob me of my son, too, and bring him up to be a dirty Yankee tradesman, or a low, beggarly painter?'
533_131562_000028_000001 It's well these women must be blabbing.
533_131562_000031_000000 And as I departed, he went on cursing and abusing my faithful friend and servant with epithets I will not defile this paper with repeating.
533_131562_000031_000005 I am a slave-a prisoner-but that is nothing; if it were myself alone I would not complain, but I am forbidden to rescue my son from ruin, and what was once my only consolation is become the crowning source of my despair.
533_131562_000032_000001 I try to look to Him and raise my heart to heaven, but it will cleave to the dust.
533_131564_000001_000000 CHAPTER forty two
533_131564_000002_000000 september first.--No mr Huntingdon yet.
533_131564_000002_000001 Perhaps he will stay among his friends till Christmas; and then, next spring, he will be off again.
533_131564_000003_000000 mr and mrs Hattersley have been staying at the Grove a fortnight: and as mr Hargrave is still absent, and the weather was remarkably fine, I never passed a day without seeing my two friends, Milicent and esther, either there or here.
533_131564_000007_000000 'no'
533_131564_000008_000000 'Well, I think you're better without him, sure enough-for my part, I'm downright weary of him.
533_131564_000008_000003 What do you think of that?'
533_131564_000010_000000 'Well, I'm not thirty yet; it isn't too late, is it?'
533_131564_000013_000000 'But should you wish yourself to be like him?'
533_131564_000015_000000 'You can't continue as bad as you are without getting worse and more brutalised every day, and therefore more like him.'
533_131564_000016_000000 I could not help smiling at the comical, half angry, half confounded look he put on at this rather unusual mode of address.
533_131564_000017_000000 'Never mind my plain speaking,' said I; 'it is from the best of motives. But tell me, should you wish your sons to be like mr Huntingdon-or even like yourself?'
533_131564_000018_000000 'Hang it!
533_131564_000018_000001 no'
533_131564_000020_000000 'Oh, no! I couldn't stand that.'
533_131564_000024_000000 'Fire and fury-'
533_131564_000026_000000 'Of course not; and I don't, and I'm not going to.'
533_131564_000029_000000 'Think of what she was five years ago, when you married her, and what she is now.'
533_131564_000030_000001 But hang it!--that's not my fault.'
533_131564_000031_000000 'What is the cause of it then?
533_131564_000031_000001 Not years, for she's only five and twenty.'
533_131564_000032_000000 'It's her own delicate health, and confound it, madam! what would you make of me?--and the children, to be sure, that worry her to death between them.'
533_131564_000034_000000 'I know they are-bless them!'
533_131564_000035_000000 'Then why lay the blame on them?--I'll tell you what it is: it's silent fretting and constant anxiety on your account, mingled, I suspect, with something of bodily fear on her own.
533_131564_000035_000002 In patient endurance of evil, she forgets it is our duty to admonish our neighbours of their transgressions.
533_131564_000035_000003 Since you will mistake her silence for indifference, come with me, and I'll show you one or two of her letters-no breach of confidence, I hope, since you are her other half.'
533_131564_000037_000002 Could it be to dash away a tear?
533_131564_000039_000001 If you intend to reform, invoke God's blessing, His mercy, and His aid; not His curse.'
533_131564_000040_000000 'God help me, then-for I'm sure I need it.
533_131564_000040_000001 Where's Milicent?'
533_131564_000041_000000 'She's there, just coming in with her sister.'
533_131564_000042_000001 I followed at a little distance.
533_131564_000042_000003 How very, very good you are!'
533_131564_000043_000000 'Nay, not I,' said he, turning her round, and pushing her towards me. 'Thank her; it's her doing.'
533_131564_000046_000000 'You never tried me, Milly,' said he.
533_131564_000047_000000 Shortly after they took their leave.
5442_41168_000001_000000 Levin was standing rather far off.
5442_41168_000001_000003 They were disputing, as far as he could make out, as to the interpretation to be put on the act and the exact meaning of the words: "liable to be called up for trial."
5442_41168_000002_000000 The crowd parted to make way for Sergey Ivanovitch approaching the table.
5442_41168_000002_000001 Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till the malignant gentleman had finished speaking, said that he thought the best solution would be to refer to the act itself, and asked the secretary to find the act.
5442_41168_000003_000000 Sergey Ivanovitch read the act and began to explain its meaning, but at that point a tall, stout, round shouldered landowner, with dyed whiskers, in a tight uniform that cut the back of his neck, interrupted him.
5442_41168_000003_000002 Put it to the vote!
5442_41168_000003_000003 No need for more talking!"
5442_41168_000003_000004 Then several voices began to talk all at once, and the tall nobleman with the ring, getting more and more exasperated, shouted more and more loudly.
5442_41168_000005_000000 "A ballot!
5442_41168_000005_000001 A ballot!
5442_41168_000005_000002 Every nobleman sees it!
5442_41168_000005_000003 We shed our blood for our country!...
5442_41168_000005_000004 The confidence of the monarch....
5442_41168_000005_000005 No checking the accounts of the marshal; he's not a cashier....
5442_41168_000005_000006 But that's not the point.... Votes, please!
5442_41168_000005_000007 Beastly!..." shouted furious and violent voices on all sides.
5442_41168_000005_000008 Looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their words.
5442_41168_000005_000009 They expressed the most implacable hatred.
5442_41168_000006_000000 "And one vote may decide the whole question, and one must be serious and consecutive, if one wants to be of use in public life," concluded Sergey Ivanovitch.
5442_41168_000006_000001 But Levin forgot all that, and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons, for whom he had a respect, in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement.
5442_41168_000006_000002 To escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar.
5442_41168_000007_000000 "Please come, Konstantin d mitrievitch," he said, "your brother's looking for you.
5442_41168_000007_000001 They are voting on the legal point."
5442_41168_000008_000001 Sergey Ivanovitch put his hand into the box, put the ball somewhere, and making room for Levin, stopped.
5442_41168_000008_000004 But the persons speaking paused, and his improper question was overheard.
5442_41168_000008_000005 Sergey Ivanovitch frowned.
5442_41168_000009_000000 "That is a matter for each man's own decision," he said severely.
5442_41168_000011_000000 "A hundred and twenty six for admission!
5442_41168_000012_000000 But the old party did not consider themselves conquered.
5442_41168_000012_000002 Levin went nearer.
5442_41168_000012_000003 In reply Snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him, the affection they had shown him, which he did not deserve, as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility, to whom he had devoted twelve years of service.
5442_41168_000012_000004 Several times he repeated the words: "I have served to the best of my powers with truth and good faith, I value your goodness and thank you," and suddenly he stopped short from the tears that choked him, and went out of the room.
5442_41168_000013_000000 In the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against Levin.
5442_41168_000014_000000 "Beg pardon, excuse me, please," he said as to a stranger, but recognizing Levin, he smiled timidly.
5442_41168_000014_000001 It seemed to Levin that he would have liked to say something, but could not speak for emotion.
5442_41168_000014_000002 His face and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses, and white trousers striped with braid, as he moved hurriedly along, reminded Levin of some hunted beast who sees that he is in evil case.
5442_41168_000014_000005 This old man was a touching and pathetic figure to Levin now, and he longed to say something pleasant to him.
5442_41168_000015_000000 "So you're sure to be our marshal again," he said.
5442_41168_000016_000000 "It's not likely," said the marshal, looking round with a scared expression.
5442_41168_000016_000001 "I'm worn out, I'm old.
5442_41168_000017_000000 And the marshal disappeared through a side door.
5442_41168_000018_000000 The most solemn moment was at hand.
5442_41168_000018_000001 They were to proceed immediately to the election.
5442_41168_000018_000002 The leaders of both parties were reckoning white and black on their fingers.
5442_41168_000019_000000 The discussion upon Flerov had given the new party not only Flerov's vote, but had also gained time for them, so that they could send to fetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable to take part in the elections by the wiles of the other party.
5442_41168_000019_000001 Two noble gentlemen, who had a weakness for strong drink, had been made drunk by the partisans of Snetkov, and a third had been robbed of his uniform.
5442_41168_000020_000000 On learning this, the new party had made haste, during the dispute about Flerov, to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the stripped gentleman, and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting.
5442_41168_000021_000001 "He's all right?
5442_41169_000001_000001 The excitement grew more intense, and every face betrayed some uneasiness.
5442_41169_000001_000003 They were the generals organizing the approaching battle.
5442_41169_000001_000004 The rest, like the rank and file before an engagement, though they were getting ready for the fight, sought for other distractions in the interval.
5442_41169_000002_000001 Levin had seen him already at the meeting on the previous day, and he had studiously avoided him, not caring to greet him.
5442_41169_000002_000002 He went to the window and sat down, scanning the groups, and listening to what was being said around him.
5442_41169_000003_000000 "He's such a blackguard!
5442_41169_000003_000001 I have told him so, but it makes no difference. Only think of it!
5442_41169_000003_000002 He couldn't collect it in three years!" he heard vigorously uttered by a round shouldered, short, country gentleman, who had pomaded hair hanging on his embroidered collar, and new boots obviously put on for the occasion, with heels that tapped energetically as he spoke.
5442_41169_000005_000000 Next, a whole crowd of country gentlemen, surrounding a stout general, hurriedly came near Levin.
5442_41169_000005_000001 These persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard.
5442_41169_000008_000000 "Oh, damn your acts!
5442_41169_000008_000001 I speak from my heart.
5442_41169_000008_000002 We're all gentlemen, aren't we?
5442_41169_000008_000003 Above suspicion."
5442_41169_000011_000001 The speaker was a country gentleman with gray whiskers, wearing the regimental uniform of an old general staff officer.
5442_41169_000011_000003 He knew him at once.
5442_41169_000012_000000 "Very glad to see you!
5442_41169_000012_000001 To be sure!
5442_41169_000012_000002 I remember you very well.
5442_41169_000012_000003 Last year at our district marshal, Nikolay Ivanovitch's."
5442_41169_000013_000000 "Well, and how is your land doing?" asked Levin.
5442_41169_000015_000000 "I ought to own that I don't very well understand the drift of the provincial elections," said Levin.
5442_41169_000016_000000 The landowner looked at him.
5442_41169_000017_000000 "Why, what is there to understand?
5442_41169_000017_000001 There's no meaning in it at all.
5442_41169_000017_000002 It's a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of inertia.
5442_41169_000018_000000 "Then why do you come?" asked Levin.
5442_41169_000019_000000 "From habit, nothing else.
5442_41169_000019_000002 It's a moral obligation of a sort.
5442_41169_000019_000003 And then, to tell the truth, there's one's own interests.
5442_41169_000019_000004 My son in law wants to stand as a permanent member; they're not rich people, and he must be brought forward.
5442_41169_000019_000005 These gentlemen, now, what do they come for?" he said, pointing to the malignant gentleman, who was talking at the high table.
5442_41169_000020_000000 "That's the new generation of nobility."
5442_41169_000021_000001 They're proprietors of a sort, but we're the landowners.
5442_41169_000021_000002 As noblemen, they're cutting their own throats."
5442_41169_000022_000000 "But you say it's an institution that's served its time."
5442_41169_000023_000000 "That it may be, but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully.
5442_41169_000023_000001 Snetkov, now....
5442_41169_000023_000002 We may be of use, or we may not, but we're the growth of a thousand years.
5442_41169_000023_000004 You won't grow him again in a year," he said cautiously, and he immediately changed the conversation.
5442_41169_000023_000005 "Well, and how is your land doing?"
5442_41169_000024_000000 "Oh, not very well.
5442_41169_000024_000001 I make five per cent."
5442_41169_000025_000000 "Yes, but you don't reckon your own work.
5442_41169_000025_000002 I'll tell you my own case.
5442_41169_000025_000005 But one's work is thrown in for nothing."
5442_41169_000026_000000 "Then why do you do it, if it's a clear loss?"
5442_41169_000027_000000 "Oh, well, one does it!
5442_41169_000027_000001 What would you have?
5442_41169_000027_000004 There's no doubt he'll be a scientific man.
5442_41169_000027_000005 So there'll be no one to keep it up.
5442_41169_000027_000006 And yet one does it.
5442_41169_000028_000000 "Yes, yes," said Levin, "that's perfectly true.
5442_41169_000029_000000 "But I tell you what," the landowner pursued; "a neighbor of mine, a merchant, was at my place.
5442_41169_000029_000004 And nowadays that bark's worth something.
5442_41169_000030_000000 "And with what he made he'd increase his stock, or buy some land for a trifle, and let it out in lots to the peasants," Levin added, smiling. He had evidently more than once come across those commercial calculations.
5442_41169_000030_000001 "And he'd make his fortune.
5442_41169_000032_000000 "Yes," Levin answered, with proud satisfaction.
5442_41169_000032_000001 "Yes, it's rather strange," he went on.
5442_41169_000033_000000 The landowner chuckled under his white mustaches.
5442_41169_000034_000000 "There are some among us, too, like our friend Nikolay Ivanovitch, or Count Vronsky, that's settled here lately, who try to carry on their husbandry as though it were a factory; but so far it leads to nothing but making away with capital on it."
5442_41169_000036_000000 "Why, as you said, to keep the fire in.
5442_41169_000036_000001 Besides that's not work for a nobleman.
5442_41169_000036_000006 Without a return too.
5442_41169_000036_000007 At a simple loss."
5442_41169_000037_000000 "Just as we do," said Levin.
5442_41169_000037_000001 "Very, very glad to have met you," he added, seeing Sviazhsky approaching him.
5484_24317_000001_000000 CHAPTER seven.
5484_24317_000002_000000 Hermon entered his house with drooping head.
5484_24317_000003_000001 His errand was to invite him to a banquet which was to take place that evening at his residence in a wing of the royal palace.
5484_24317_000004_000000 But Hermon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel, and he frankly said so, although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honour of the seventieth birthday of the old sculptor Euphranor.
5484_24317_000004_000001 The grammateus alluded to this, and most positively insisted that he could not release him; for he came not only by his own wish, but in obedience to the command of Queen Arsinoe, who desired to tell the creator of the Demeter how highly she esteemed his work and his art.
5484_24317_000004_000002 She would appear herself at dessert, and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour.
5484_24317_000004_000003 He, Proclus, was to have the high honour of including the royal lady among his guests solely on Hermon's account, and his refusal would be an insult to the Queen.
5484_24317_000005_000000 So the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition.
5484_24317_000006_000000 The banquet was to begin in a few hours, yet he could not let the day pass without seeing Daphne and telling her the words of the oracle.
5484_24317_000007_000000 Oh, if only his Myrtilus still walked among the living!
5484_24317_000007_000001 How totally different, in spite of his lost vision, would his life have been!
5484_24317_000009_000000 Since his return from the oracle, the fear that the rescued Demeter might yet be the work of Myrtilus had again mastered him.
5484_24317_000009_000001 However loudly outward circumstances might oppose this, he now felt, with a certainty which surprised him, that this work was not his own.
5484_24317_000009_000002 The approval, as well as the doubts, which it aroused in others strengthened his opinion, although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts.
5484_24317_000011_000000 He would frankly inform her of his fear, and her truthful nature would find the doubt that gnawed his heart as unendurable as he himself.
5484_24317_000013_000000 Time pressed.
5484_24317_000016_000000 Then he went directly to the neighbouring palace.
5484_24317_000016_000001 The Queen might have appeared already, and it would not do to keep her waiting.
5484_24317_000019_000001 Hitherto the merchant had been induced, it is true, to advance large sums of money to the Queen, but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered it impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy.
5484_24317_000020_000000 When Hermon entered the residence of the grammateus in the palace, the guests had already assembled.
5484_24317_000020_000001 The Queen was not to appear until after the feast, when the mixing jars were filled.
5484_24317_000021_000000 The sovereign was as unaccustomed to the society of a blind artist as Hermon was to that of a queen, and both eagerly anticipated the approaching meeting.
5484_24317_000022_000000 Yet it was difficult for Hermon to turn a bright face toward his companion.
5484_24317_000023_000001 During many a sleepless hour of the night he had once more heard the rolling of her terrible wheel.
5484_24317_000025_000000 True, an interesting conversation still had power to charm him, but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind; for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight, and referred to new creations of architecture, sculpture, and painting, from whose enjoyment his blindness debarred him.
5484_24317_000029_000000 Would his troubled spirit at least permit him to enjoy and enter without restraint into the play of her quick wit?
5484_24317_000030_000000 Perhaps her arrival would relieve him from the discomfort which oppressed him here.
5484_24317_000031_000000 A stranger, out of his own sphere, he felt chilled among these closely united men and women, to whom no tie bound him save the presence of the same host.
5484_24317_000033_000000 The artist was surprised to find this man in such a circle, but he learned from Althea that the young member of the Museum was a relative of Proclus, and a suitor of the beautiful Nico, one of the Queen's ladies in waiting, who was among the guests.
5484_24317_000034_000000 Crates had really been invited in order to win him over to the Queen's cause; but charming fair haired Nico had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing Arsinoe's praises among his professional associates.
5484_24317_000035_000001 All were members of the highest class of society, and their manners showed the entire freedom from restraint that existed in the Queen's immediate circle.
5484_24317_000035_000002 Althea profited by the advantage of being Hermon's only acquaintance here.
5484_24317_000036_000000 The most aristocratic was Amyntas, who stood highest of all in the Queen's favour because he had good reason to hate the other Arsinoe, the sister of the King.
5484_24317_000039_000000 "The King's sister-the object of his love?" cried Hermon incredulously. "She must be forty years old now."
5484_24317_000040_000000 "Very true," Althea assented.
5484_24317_000040_000001 "But we are in Egypt, where marriages between brothers and sisters are pleasing to gods and men; and besides, we make our own moral laws here.
5484_24317_000040_000002 Her age!
5484_24317_000040_000004 She will make our poor Queen suffer unless real friends guard her from the worst.
5484_24317_000040_000006 Let us hope that you will make this three leaved clover the luck promising four leaved one.
5484_24317_000041_000000 "That is going too far," replied Hermon.
5484_24317_000042_000001 "Had I not made it a rule to maintain absolute silence concerning everything I hear in conversation from those with whom I am closely associated-"
5484_24317_000044_000001 The royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest, and Althea eagerly confirmed the statement.
5484_24317_000045_000000 Hermon listened to the pair in silence.
5484_24317_000047_000000 The remembrance of Arsinoe's undignified conduct at the Dionysia, and the shameful stories of her which he had heard returned to his mind.
5484_24317_000047_000001 At the same time he saw Daphne rise before him in her aristocratic dignity and kindly goodness, and a smile of satisfaction hovered around his lips as he said to himself: "The spider Althea again!
5484_24317_000047_000002 But, in spite of my blindness, I will be caught neither in her net nor in the Queen's.
5484_24317_000049_000000 Hermon replied that he had heard several make this criticism, but the priests of the goddess refused to take it into account.
5484_24317_000050_000000 Here he hesitated, for, like a blow from an invisible hand, the thought darted through his mind that perhaps, on the morrow, he would see himself compelled before the whole world to cast aside the crown of fame which he owed to the statue on the lofty pedestal.
5484_24317_000051_000000 Yet what mattered it, even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of scorn at him?
5484_24317_000051_000001 Better people would thereby be robbed of the right to accuse him of faithlessness to himself.
5484_24317_000052_000000 She perceived this with annoyance and perplexity.
5484_24317_000053_000000 A woman who yearns for the regard of all men, and makes love a toy, easily lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals.
5484_24317_000053_000001 Only, even though love has wholly disappeared, she still claims consideration, and Althea did not wish to lose Hermon's regard.
5484_24317_000054_000001 How indifferent you look!
5484_24317_000054_000002 But I tell you"--her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke-"that so long as you were still a genuine creating artist the case was different. Even while putting the last touches of the file to the Demeter, for which Archias's devout daughter posed as your model, another whom you could not banish from your mind filled your imagination.
5484_24317_000054_000003 Though so loud a denial is written on your face, I persist in my conviction, and that no idle delusion ensnares me I can prove!"
5484_24317_000055_000001 Not the smallest detail of a work produced by the hand of a valued friend escapes my notice, and I perceived it before the Demeter came to the temple and the lofty pedestal.
5484_24317_000055_000003 How bewildered you look!
5484_24317_000055_000004 Eternal gods!
5484_24317_000055_000005 Many things are forgotten after long months have passed, but it will be easy for me to sharpen your memory.
5484_24317_000055_000007 Was it really nothing but foolish vanity that led me to the conviction that you were thinking of me also when you engraved on the ribbon the despised spider for which, however, I always felt a certain regard-with the delicate web beneath its slender legs?"
5484_24317_000056_000000 Hitherto Hermon had listened to every word in silence, labouring for breath.
5484_24317_000056_000001 He was transported as if by magic to the hour of his return from Pelusium; he saw himself enter Myrtilus's studio and watch his friend scratch something, he did not know what, upon the ribbon which fastened the bunch of golden grain.
5484_24317_000056_000002 It was-nay, it could have been nothing else-that very spider.
5484_24317_000056_000004 How the exchange had occurred he could not now understand, but to disbelieve that it had taken place would have been madness or self deception.
5484_24317_000057_000001 Not he-Myrtilus, and he alone, was the creator of the much lauded Demeter!
5484_24317_000058_000000 This conviction raised a hundred pound weight from his soul.
5484_24317_000059_000000 What was applause!
5484_24317_000059_000001 What was recognition!
5484_24317_000059_000004 The dead Myrtilus created it!"
5484_24317_000060_000001 Only let me get out of doors into the open air!"
5484_24317_000061_000000 Crates, bewildered and prepared for the worst, obeyed his wish; but Althea and the other guests left behind felt more and more impressed by the suddenly awakened conviction that the hapless blind man had now also become the victim of madness.
5484_24318_000001_000000 CHAPTER eight.
5484_24318_000002_000000 Without a word of explanation, Hermon dragged his guide along in breathless haste.
5484_24318_000002_000001 No one stopped them.
5484_24318_000003_000000 The atrium, usually swarming with guards, servants, and officials until a far later hour, was completely deserted when the blind man hurried through it with his friend.
5484_24318_000004_000001 Not a sound, if you value your lives!"
5484_24318_000007_000000 Was he to be led to the executioner's block?
5484_24318_000008_000000 What pleasure had life to offer him, the blind man, who was already dead to his art?
5484_24318_000010_000001 Wherever the beloved dead might be, he desired to go there also.
5484_24318_000010_000002 Whatever might await him, he desired no better fate.
5484_24318_000010_000003 If he had passed into annihilation, he, Hermon, wished to follow him thither, and annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery.
5484_24318_000011_000000 Only his heart grew heavy at the thought of leaving Daphne to the tireless wooer Philotas or some other-everything else from which it is usually hard to part seemed like a burden that we gladly cast aside.
5484_24318_000012_000000 "Forward!" he called blithely and boldly to the officer; while Crates, with loud lamentations, was protesting his innocence to the warrior who was putting fetters upon him.
5484_24318_000013_000001 His keen ear could not deceive him, and yet a demon must be mocking him, for the voice that had called his name was the girl's of whom, in the presence of welcome death, he had thought with longing regret.
5484_24318_000014_000001 Again he heard the beloved voice, and this time it addressed not only him, but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers.
5484_24318_000015_000000 Sometimes with touching entreaty, sometimes with imperious command, she protested, after giving him her name, that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake.
5484_24318_000015_000001 Lastly, with earnest warmth, she besought him, before taking the prisoners away, to permit her to speak to the commanding general, Philippus, her father's guest, who, she was certain, was in the palace.
5484_24318_000015_000002 The blood of these innocent men would be on his head if he did not listen to her representations.
5484_24318_000016_000000 "Daphne!" cried Hermon in grateful agitation; but she would not listen to him, and followed the soldier whom the captain detailed to guide her into the palace.
5484_24318_000017_000000 After a few moments, which the blind artist used to inspire the despairing scholar with courage, the girl returned, and she did not come alone.
5484_24318_000017_000001 The gray haired comrade of Alexander accompanied her, and after a few minutes both prisoners were released from their fetters.
5484_24318_000017_000003 To morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path."
5484_24318_000019_000000 Early the next morning they should be examined, and, if they could clear themselves from the suspicion of belonging to the ranks of the conspirators, released.
5484_24318_000020_000000 Daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners, but Philippus silenced her with the grave exclamation, "The order of the King!"
5484_24318_000021_000000 The old commander offered no objection to her wish to accompany Hermon to prison.
5484_24318_000022_000000 The goal of the nocturnal walk, which was close at hand, was reached at the end of a few minutes, and the prisoners were delivered to the commander of the Diadochi.
5484_24318_000024_000001 For the first time his lips met hers, he confessed his love, and that he had just regarded death as a deliverer; but his life was now gaining new charm through her affection.
5484_24318_000025_000000 Then Daphne herself threw her arms around his neck with fervent devotion.
5484_24318_000026_000001 In spite of his deep mental distress, he could have shouted aloud in his delight and gratitude.
5484_24318_000026_000002 He might now have been permitted to bind forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger, but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the palaestra the following morning still sealed his lips.
5484_24318_000026_000004 Words can not express the strength of my devotion, but for that very reason I must do what duty commands before I ask the question, 'Will you join your fate to mine?'"
5484_24318_000027_000000 "I love you and have loved you always!" Daphne exclaimed tenderly.
5484_24318_000027_000001 "What more is needed?"
5484_24318_000028_000000 But Hermon, with drooping head, murmured: "To morrow I shall no longer be what I am now.
5484_24318_000029_000000 Then Daphne raised her face to his, asking, "So the Demeter is the work of Myrtilus?"
5484_24318_000030_000000 "Certainly," he answered firmly.
5484_24318_000030_000001 "It is the work of Myrtilus."
5484_24318_000031_000000 "Oh, my poor, deceived love!" cried Daphne, strongly agitated, in a tone of the deepest sorrow.
5484_24318_000031_000001 "What a terrible ordeal again awaits you!
5484_24318_000031_000003 It seems nevertheless as if I ought to rejoice, for you and your art have not spoken to me even a single moment from this much lauded work."
5484_24318_000032_000002 But only wait, wait!
5484_24318_000032_000003 Soon to morrow even-there will be no one in Alexandria who can accuse me of deserting my own honest aspiration, and, if the gods will only restore my sight and the ability to use my hands as a sculptor, then, girl, then-"
5484_24318_000034_000000 The time allowed had expired.
5484_24318_000035_000000 Hermon again warmly embraced Daphne, saying: "Then go!
5484_24318_000035_000001 Nothing can cloud what these brief moments have bestowed.
5484_24318_000035_000002 I must remain blind; but you have restored the lost sight to my poor darkened soul.
5484_24318_000035_000004 Many will not believe me, and even your father will perhaps consider it a disgrace to give his arm to his scorned, calumniated nephew to guide him home.
5484_24318_000035_000005 Bring this before your mind, and everything else that you must accept with it, if you consent, when the time arrives, to become mine. Conceal and palliate nothing!
5484_24318_000037_000000 When Thyone in her presence heard from Gras that Hermon intended to go to Proclus's banquet, she started up in horror, exclaiming, "Then the unfortunate man is lost!"
5484_24318_000038_000000 Her husband, who had long trusted even the gravest secrets to his discreet old wife, had informed her of the terrible office the King had confided to him.
5484_24318_000039_000000 Then Daphne, on her knees, besought the matron to tell her what threatened Hermon, and succeeded in persuading her to speak.
5484_24318_000042_000000 Grateful and moved by joyous hopes, he informed Daphne of the words of the oracle, which had imprinted themselves upon his memory.
5484_24318_000043_000000 She, too, quickly retained them, and murmured softly:
5484_24318_000044_000000 "Noise and dazzling radiance are hostile to the purer light, Morning and day will rise quietly from the starving sand."
5484_24318_000046_000000 Perhaps it would be well for him to leave Alexandria now, and she described how much benefit she had received while hunting from the silence of the wilderness, when she had left the noise of the city behind her.
5484_24318_000047_000000 The lovers took leave of each other with one last kiss, and the final words of the departing girl echoed consolingly in the blind man's heart, "The more they take from you, the more closely I will cling to you."
5484_24318_000051_000000 Yet he was forced to advise the blind sculptor to leave Alexandria.
5484_24318_000052_000003 Daphne, of course, would accompany him.
5484_24318_000053_000000 The prisoner listened in surprise and anxiety.
5484_24318_000054_000000 His uncle driven from his secure possessions to distant lands!
5484_24318_000054_000001 Daphne taken from him, he knew not whither nor for how long a time, after he had just been assured of her great love!
5484_24318_000054_000002 He himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city!
5484_24318_000058_000000 The old man's conversation with Hermon was interrupted by the functionaries who subjected him and Crates to the examination.
5484_24318_000064_000000 On the way his heart throbbed almost to bursting.
5484_24318_000065_000000 Even Daphne's image, and what threatened her father, and her with him, receded far into the background.
5484_24318_000067_000000 Yet no!
5484_24318_000068_000000 Did he still possess the right to award this noble branch to any one?
5484_24318_000068_000001 He was appearing before his companions only to give truth its just due.
5484_24318_000068_000002 It was repulsive to endow this explanation of an unfortunate error with a captivating aspect by any theatrical adornment.
5484_24318_000071_000000 The Egyptian obeyed, and his master crossed the wide space, strewn with sand, and approached the stage which had been erected for the festal performances.
5484_24318_000072_000000 Even had his eyes retained the power of sight, his blood was coursing so wildly through his veins that he might perhaps have been unable to distinguish the statues around him and the thousands of spectators, who, crowded closely together, richly garlanded, their cheeks glowing with enthusiasm, surrounded the arena.
5484_24318_000076_000003 Even while he believed himself to be the creator of the Demeter, he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics, because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithless to his art and his nature.
5484_24318_000076_000004 In the name of the dead, he thanked his dear comrades for the enthusiastic appreciation his masterpiece had found.
5484_24318_000076_000005 Honour to Myrtilus and his art, but he trusted this noble festal assemblage would pardon the unintentional deception, and aid his prayer for recovery.
5484_24318_000077_000001 We will beseech the immortals with prayers and sacrifices to restore sight to your artist eyes.
5484_24318_000079_000000 When he again descended to the arena new plaudits rose; but soon hisses and other signs of disapproval blended with them, which increased in strength and number when a well known critic, who had written a learned treatise concerning the relation of the Demeter to Hermon's earlier works, expressed his annoyance in a loud whistle.
5484_24318_000080_000000 Probably every man thought that, in the same situation, he would have done the same yet not only justice-nay, compassion-dictated showing the blind artist that they believed in and would sustain him.
5484_24318_000080_000001 The ill disposed insisted that Hermon had only done what duty commanded the meanest man, and the fact that he had deceived all Alexandria still remained.
5639_40744_000000_000000 There was in that city a young cavalier, about two and twenty years of age, whom wealth, high birth, a wayward disposition, inordinate indulgence, and profligate companions impelled to do things which disgraced his rank.
5639_40744_000000_000002 The two parties, the sheep and the wolves, met each other. Rodolfo and his companions, with their faces muffled in their cloaks, stared rudely and insolently at the mother, the daughter, and the servant maid.
5639_40744_000000_000004 But Rodolfo had been struck by the great beauty of Leocadia, the hidalgo's daughter, and presently he began to entertain the idea of enjoying it at all hazards.
5639_40744_000001_000002 Finally, the one party went off exulting, and the other was left in desolation and woe.
5639_40744_000002_000001 They were afraid to appeal for justice to the laws, lest thereby they should only publish their daughter's disgrace; besides, though well born they were poor, and had not the means of commanding influence and favour; and above all, they knew not the name of their injurer, or of whom or what to complain but their luckless stars.
5639_40744_000003_000000 Apathy and disgust commonly follow satiated lust.
5639_40744_000003_000001 Rodolfo was now impatient to get rid of Leocadia, and made up his mind to lay her in the street, insensible as she was.
5639_40744_000003_000005 Am I in bed?
5639_40744_000003_000006 Mother! dear father! do you hear me?
5639_40744_000003_000009 Whoever thou art," She exclaimed, suddenly seizing Rodolfo's hand, "if thy soul is capable of pity, grant me one prayer: having deprived me of honour, now deprive me of life.
5639_40744_000003_000010 Let me not survive my disgrace!
5639_40744_000003_000011 In mercy kill me this moment!
5639_40744_000003_000012 It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me."
5639_40744_000004_000008 You may wonder to hear me speak thus, being so young.
5639_40744_000004_000009 I am surprised at it myself; and I perceive that if great sorrows are sometimes dumb, they are sometimes eloquent. Be this as it may, grant me the favour I implore: it will cost you little.
5639_40744_000004_000011 But you must also swear not to follow me, or make any attempts to ascertain my name or that of my family, who if they were as wealthy as they are noble, would not have to bear patiently such insult in my person.
5639_40744_000005_000001 "Base villain," she cried, "you took an infamous advantage of me when I had no more power to resist than a stock or a stone; but now that I have recovered my senses, you shall kill me before you shall succeed.
5639_40744_000006_000001 She found the door, but it was locked outside.
5639_40744_000006_000002 She succeeded in opening the window; and the moonlight shone in so brightly, that she could distinguish the colour of some damask hangings in the room.
5639_40744_000006_000004 She counted the chairs and the cabinets, observed the position of the door, and also perceived some pictures hanging on the walls, but was not able to distinguish the subjects.
5639_40744_000006_000005 The window was large, and protected by a stout iron grating: it looked out on a garden, surrounded by high walls, so that escape in that direction was as impossible as by the door.
5639_40744_000007_000001 Among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver, standing on a cabinet near the window.
5639_40744_000007_000004 In about half an hour, as it seemed to her, the door was opened; some one came in, blindfolded her, and taking her by the arm, without a word spoken, led her out of the room, which she heard him lock behind him.
5639_40744_000008_000002 Having come to this resolution, he hastened back to remove Leocadia before daylight appeared, which would compel him to keep her in his room all the following day.
5639_40744_000009_000001 To baffle any spies that might perchance be watching her, she entered a house which she found open; and by and by she went from it to her own, where she found her parents stupefied with grief.
5639_40744_000009_000002 They had not undressed, or thought of taking any rest.
5639_40744_000010_000003 What you had best do, my child, is to keep it, and pray to it, that since it was a witness to your undoing, it will deign to vindicate your cause by its righteous judgment.
5639_40744_000010_000005 Real dishonour consists in sin, and real honour in virtue.
5639_40744_000011_000001 In spite of all their tenderness her anguish was too poignant to be soon allayed; and from that fatal night, she continued to live the life of a recluse under the protection of her parents.
5639_40744_000012_000000 Rodolfo meanwhile having returned home, and having missed the crucifix, guessed who had taken it, but gave himself no concern about it.
5639_40744_000012_000002 Rodolfo had long contemplated a visit to Italy; and his father, who himself had been there, encouraged him in that design, telling him that no one could be a finished gentleman without seeing foreign countries.
5639_40744_000012_000003 For this and other reasons, Rodolfo readily complied with the wishes of his father, who gave him ample letters of credit on Barcelona, Genoa, Rome, and Naples.
5639_40744_000012_000006 She meanwhile passed her life with her parents in the strictest retirement, never letting herself be seen, but shunning every eye lest it should read her misfortune in her face.
5639_40744_000012_000007 What she had thus done voluntarily at first, she found herself, in a few months, constrained to do by necessity; for she discovered that she was pregnant, to the grievous renewal of her affliction.
5639_40744_000013_000000 Time rolled on: the hour of her delivery arrived: it took place in the utmost secrecy, her mother taking upon her the office of midwife: and she gave birth to a son, one of the most beautiful ever seen.
5639_40744_000013_000002 The boy, who was named Luis after his grandfather, was remarkably handsome, of a sweet docile disposition; and his manners and deportment, even at that tender age, were such as showed him to be the son of some noble father.
5639_40744_000013_000003 His grandfather and grandmother were so delighted with his grace, beauty, and good behaviour, that they came at last to regard their daughter's mischance as a happy event, since it had given them such a grandson.
5639_40744_000014_000000 One day, when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation, he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horsemen.
5639_40744_000014_000003 The poor child lay senseless on the ground, bleeding profusely from his head.
5639_40744_000015_000000 Many gentlemen followed him, greatly distressed at the sad accident which had befallen the general favourite; for it was soon on everybody's lips that the sufferer was little Luis.
5639_40744_000015_000001 The news speedily reached the ears of his grandparents and his supposed cousin, who all hurried in wild dismay to look for their darling.
5639_40744_000015_000002 The gentleman who had humanely taken charge of him being of eminent rank, and well known, they easily found their way to his house, and arrived there just as Luis was under the surgeon's hands.
5639_40744_000015_000003 The master and mistress begged them not to cry, or raise their voices in lamentation; for it would do the little patient no good.
5639_40744_000015_000007 The surgeon desired them not to talk to him, but leave him to repose.
5639_40744_000015_000009 The gentleman replied that there was nothing to thank him for; the fact being, that when he saw the boy knocked down, his first thought was that he saw under the horses' heels the face of a son of his own, whom he tenderly loved.
5639_40744_000015_000011 The lady of the house spoke to the same effect, and with no less kindness and cordiality.
5639_40744_000016_000001 The damask hangings were no longer there; but she recognised it by other tokens. She saw the grated window that opened on the garden: it was then closed on account of the little patient; but she asked if there was a garden on the outside, and was answered in the affirmative.
5639_40744_000016_000002 The bed she too well remembered was there; and, above all, the cabinet, on which had stood the image she had taken away, was still on the same spot.
5639_40744_000016_000003 Finally, to corroborate all the other indications, and confirm the truth of her discovery beyond all question, she counted the steps of the staircase leading from the room to the street, and found the number exactly what she had expected; for she had had the presence of mind to count them on the former occasion, when she descended them blindfold.
5639_40744_000016_000006 She made all this known to her husband; and it was finally settled between the three that they should not move in the matter for the present, but wait till the will of Heaven had declared itself respecting the little patient.
5639_40744_000017_000000 Luis was out of danger in a fortnight; in a month he rose from his bed; and during all that time he was visited daily by his mother and grandmother, and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if he was their own child.
5639_40744_000017_000001 Dona Estafania, the kind gentleman's wife, often observed, in conversation with Leocadia, that the boy so strongly resembled a son of hers who was in Italy, she never could look at him without thinking her son was actually before her.
5639_40744_000018_000002 But, as the proverb says, with the disease God sends the remedy.
5639_40744_000018_000003 The boy found his recovery in this house; and I found in it reminiscences of events I shall never forget as long as I live.
5639_40744_000020_000001 On seeing his wife all in tears, and Leocadia fainting, he eagerly inquired the cause of so startling a spectacle.
5639_40744_000020_000002 The boy having embraced his mother, calling her his cousin, and his grandmother, calling her his benefactress, repeated his grandfather's question.
5639_40744_000020_000004 This truth which I have learned from her lips is confirmed by his face, in which we have both beheld that of our son."
5639_40744_000021_000000 "Unless you speak more fully, senora, I cannot understand you," replied her husband.
5639_40744_000022_000000 Just then Leocadia came to herself, and embracing the cross seemed changed into a sea of tears, and the gentleman remained in utter bewilderment, until his wife had repeated to him, from beginning to end, Leocadia's whole story; and he believed it, through the blessed dispensation of Heaven, which had confirmed it by so many convincing testimonies.
5639_40744_000022_000001 He embraced and comforted Leocadia, kissed his grandson, and that same day he despatched a courier to Naples, with a letter to his son, requiring him to come home instantly, for his mother and he had concluded a suitable match for him with a very beautiful lady.
5639_40744_000023_000001 After a prosperous run of twelve days, he reached Barcelona, whence he posted in seven to Toledo, and entered his father's house, dressed in the very extreme of fashionable bravery.
5639_40744_000023_000003 Rodolfo's two comrades proposed to take leave of him at once, and retire to their own homes; but Estafania would not suffer them to depart, for their presence was needful for the execution of a scheme she had in her head.
5639_40744_000024_000000 It was nearly night when Rodolfo arrived; and whilst preparations were making for supper, Estafania took her son's companions aside, believing that they were two of the three whom Leocadia mentioned as having been with Rodolfo on the night of her abduction.
5639_40744_000024_000001 She earnestly entreated them to tell her, if they remembered that her son had carried off a young woman, on such a night, so many years ago; for the honour and the peace of mind of all his relations depended on their knowing the truth of that matter.
5639_40744_000024_000003 They added that Rodolfo told them, on the following day, that he had carried the girl to his own apartment; and this was all they knew of the matter.
5639_40744_000026_000005 As for high birth, thank Heaven and my ancestors I am well enough off in that respect; as for understanding, provided a woman is neither a dolt nor a simpleton, there is no need of her having a very subtle wit; in point of wealth, I am amply provided by my parents; but beauty is what I covet, with no other addition than virtue and good breeding.
5639_40744_000026_000006 If my wife brings me this, I will thank Heaven for the gift, and make my parents happy in their old age."
5639_40744_000027_000001 She told him that she would endeavour to marry him in conformity with his inclination, and that he need not make himself uneasy, for there would be no difficulty in breaking off the match which seemed so distasteful to him.
5639_40744_000027_000002 Rodolfo thanked her, and supper being ready they went to join the rest of the party at table.
5639_40744_000027_000003 The father and mother, Rodolfo and his two companions had already seated themselves, when Dona Estafania said, in an off hand way, "Sinner that I am, how well I behave to my guest!
5639_40744_000027_000004 Go," she said to a servant, "and ask the senora.
5639_40744_000028_000000 The lady soon appeared, presenting a most charming spectacle of perfect beauty, set off by the most appropriate adornments.
5639_40744_000028_000001 The season being winter, she was dressed in a robe and train of black velvet, with gold and pearl buttons; her girdle and necklace were of diamonds; her head was uncovered, and the shining braids and ringlets of her thick chestnut hair, spangled with diamonds, dazzled the eyes of the beholders.
5639_40744_000028_000002 Her bearing was graceful and animated; she led her son by the hand, and before her walked two maids with wax lights and silver candlesticks.
5639_40744_000028_000003 All rose to do her reverence, as if something from heaven had miraculously appeared before them; but gazing on her, entranced with admiration, not one of them was able to address a single word to her.
5639_40744_000028_000008 The hopes her mother had given her of being his wife began to droop, and the fear came strong upon her that such bliss was not for one so luckless as herself.
5639_40744_000028_000009 She reflected how near she stood to the crisis which was to determine whether she was to be blessed or unhappy for ever, and racked by the intensity of her emotions, she suddenly changed colour, her head dropped, and she fell forward in a swoon into the arms of the dismayed Estafania.
5639_40744_000029_000002 This shocking news reached the ears of her parents, whom Dona Estafania had concealed in another room that they might make their appearance at the right moment.
5639_40744_000029_000005 He was greatly confused at finding that he had betrayed such emotion; but his mother, who guessed his thoughts, said to him, "Do not be ashamed, my son, at having been so overcome by your feelings; you would have been so still more had you known what I will no longer conceal from you, though I had intended to reserve it for a more joyful occasion.
5639_40744_000029_000006 Know then, son of my heart, that this fainting lady is your real bride: I say real, because she is the one whom your father and I have chosen for you, and the portrait was a pretence."
5639_40744_000030_000003 This was done; for the event took place at a time when the consent of the parties was sufficient for the celebration of a marriage, without any of the preliminary formalities which are now so properly required.
5639_40744_000031_000000 "Once when I recovered from a swoon," replied Leocadia, "I found myself, senor, in your arms without honour; but for that I have had full compensation, since on my recovery from my this day's swoon I found myself in the same arms, but honoured.
5639_40744_000033_000000 At last they sat down to a merry supper to the sound of music, for the performers, who had been previously engaged, were now arrived.
5639_40744_000033_000002 The four grandparents wept for joy: there was not a corner of the house but was full of gladness; and though night was hurrying on with her swift black wings, it seemed to Rodolfo that she did not fly, but hobble on crutches, so great was his impatience to be alone with his beloved bride.
5683_32865_000001_000000 THE ACE OF HEARTS.
5683_32865_000003_000002 I glanced round for Wylder, but he was not there.
5683_32865_000004_000000 'You know Captain Lake?' said Lord Chelford, addressing me.
5683_32865_000005_000000 And Lake turned round upon me, a little abruptly, his odd yellowish eyes, a little like those of the sea eagle, and the ghost of his smile that flickered on his singularly pale face, with a stern and insidious look, confronted me.
5683_32865_000005_000001 There was something evil and shrinking in his aspect, which I felt with a sort of chill, like the commencing fascination of a serpent.
5683_32865_000005_000002 I often thought since that he had expected to see Wylder before him.
5683_32865_000006_000000 The church yard meteor expired, there was nothing in a moment but his ordinary smile of recognition.
5683_32865_000008_000001 I'm bad at genealogies.
5683_32865_000008_000002 My mother could tell us all about it-we, Brandons, Lakes; Wylders, and Chelfords.'
5683_32865_000009_000000 At this moment Miss Brandon entered, with her brilliant Cousin Rachel. The blonde and the dark, it was a dazzling contrast.
5683_32865_000010_000000 So Chelford led Stanley Lake before the lady of the castle.
5683_32865_000010_000001 I thought of the 'Fair Brunnisende,' with the captive knight in the hands of her seneschal before her, and I fancied he said something of having found him trespassing in her town, and brought him up for judgment.
5683_32865_000010_000002 Whatever Lord Chelford said, Miss Brandon received it very graciously, and even with a momentary smile.
5683_32865_000010_000003 I wonder she did not smile oftener, it became her so. But her greeting to Captain Lake was more than usually haughty and frozen, and her features, I fancied, particularly proud and pale.
5683_32865_000010_000004 It seemed to me to indicate a great deal more than mere indifference-something of aversion, and nearer to a positive emotion than anything I had yet seen in that exquisitely apathetic face.
5683_32865_000012_000000 'Shake hands with your cousin, my dear,' said old Lady Chelford, peremptorily.
5683_32865_000013_000002 Her conversation was lively, and rather bold, not at all in the coarse sense, but she struck me as having formed a system of ethics and views of life, both good humoured and sarcastic, and had carried into her rustic sequestration the melancholy and precocious lore of her early London experience.
5683_32865_000014_000000 When Lord Chelford joined us, I perceived that Wylder was in the room, and saw a very cordial greeting between him and Lake.
5683_32865_000014_000001 The captain appeared quite easy and cheerful; but Mark, I thought, notwithstanding his laughter and general jollity, was uncomfortable; and I saw him once or twice, when Stanley's eye was not upon him, glance sharply on the young man with an uneasy and not very friendly curiosity.
5683_32865_000015_000000 At dinner Lake was easy and amusing.
5683_32865_000015_000001 That meal passed off rather pleasantly; and when we joined the ladies in the drawing room, the good vicar's enthusiastic little wife came to meet us, in one of her honest little raptures.
5683_32865_000016_000000 'Now, here's a thing worth your looking at!
5683_32865_000016_000002 It is such a darling little thing; and-look now-is not it magnificent?'
5683_32865_000017_000000 She arrested the file of gentlemen just by a large lamp, before whose effulgence she presented the subject of her eulogy-one of those costly trifles which announce the approach of Hymen, as flowers spring up before the rosy steps of May.
5683_32865_000018_000000 Well, it was pretty-French, I dare say-a little set of tablets-a toy-the cover of enamel, studded in small jewels, with a slender border of symbolic flowers, and with a heart in the centre, a mosaic of little carbuncles, rubies, and other red and crimson stones, placed with a view to light and shade.
5683_32865_000019_000001 'Is this yours, mrs Wylder?'
5683_32865_000020_000000 'Mine, indeed!' laughed poor little mrs Dorothy. 'Well, dear me, no, indeed;'--and in an earnest whisper close in his ear-'a present to Miss Brandon, and the donor is not a hundred miles away from your elbow, my lord!' and she winked slyly, and laughed, with a little nod at Wylder.
5683_32865_000021_000001 I see-to be sure-really, Wylder, it does your taste infinite credit.'
5683_32865_000022_000000 'I'm glad you like it,' says Wylder, chuckling benignantly on it, over his shoulder.
5683_32865_000023_000001 Have you seen it, Captain Lake?' And he placed it in that gentleman's fingers, who now took his turn at the lamp, and contemplated the little parallelogram with a gleam of sly amusement.
5683_32865_000024_000000 'What are you laughing at?' asked Wylder, a little snappishly.
5683_32865_000026_000000 'Fie, Lake, there's no poetry in you,' said Lord Chelford, laughing.
5683_32865_000027_000001 Look at it, do, mr Wylder-isn't it like the ace of hearts?'
5683_32865_000028_000000 Wylder was laughing rather redly, with the upper part of his face very surly, I thought.
5683_32865_000029_000000 'Never mind, Wylder, it's the winning card,' said Lord Chelford, laying his hand on his shoulder.
5683_32865_000030_000000 Whereupon Lake laughed quietly, still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes.
5683_32865_000031_000000 And Wylder laughed too, more suddenly and noisily than the humour of the joke seemed quite to call for, and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes on Lake, but the gallant captain did not seem to perceive it; and after a few seconds more he handed it very innocently back to mrs Dorothy, only remarking-
5683_32865_000034_000000 'What the d- has he come down here for?
5683_32865_000034_000001 It can't be for money, or balls, or play, and he has no honest business anywhere.
5683_32865_000034_000002 Do you know?'
5683_32865_000035_000000 'Lake?
5683_32865_000035_000001 Oh!
5683_32865_000035_000002 I really can't tell; but he'll soon tire of country life.
5683_32865_000035_000003 I don't think he's much of a sportsman.'
5683_32865_000036_000001 I don't know anything about him almost; but I hate him.'
5683_32865_000037_000000 'Why should you, though?
5683_32865_000037_000001 He's a very gentlemanlike fellow and your cousin.'
5683_32865_000038_000001 I don't know who's my cousin, or who isn't; nor you don't, who've been for ten years over those d-d papers; but I think he's the nastiest dog I ever met.
5683_32865_000038_000002 I took a dislike to him at first sight long ago, and that never happened me but I was right.'
5683_32865_000039_000000 Wylder looked confoundedly angry and flustered, standing with his heels on the edge of the rug, his hands in his pockets, jingling some silver there, and glancing from under his red forehead sternly and unsteadily across the room.
5683_32865_000040_000000 'He's not a man for country quarters!
5683_32865_000040_000001 he'll soon be back in town, or to Brighton,' I said.
5683_32865_000041_000001 That's all.'
5683_32865_000042_000000 Just to get him off this unpleasant groove with a little jolt, I said-
5683_32865_000043_000000 'By the bye, Wylder, you know the pictures here; who is the tall man, with the long pale face, and wild phosphoric eyes?
5683_32865_000043_000001 I was always afraid of him; in a long peruke, and dark red velvet coat, facing the hall door.
5683_32865_000044_000000 'That?
5683_32865_000044_000001 Oh, I know-that's Lorne Brandon.
5683_32865_000044_000003 A devil in a family now and then is not such a bad thing, when there's work for him.' (All the time he was talking to me his angry little eyes were following Lake.) 'They say he killed his son, a blackguard, who was found shot, with his face in the tarn in the park.
5683_32865_000044_000004 He was going to marry the gamekeeper's daughter, it was thought, and he and the old boy, who was for high blood, and all that, were at loggerheads about it.
5683_32865_000044_000005 It was not proved, only thought likely, which showed what a nice character he was; but he might have done worse.
5683_32865_000044_000006 I suppose Miss Partridge would have had a precious lot of babbies; and who knows where the estate would have been by this time.'
5683_32865_000045_000000 'I believe, Charlie,' he recommenced suddenly, 'there is not such an unnatural family on record as ours; is there?
5683_32865_000045_000002 It's well to be distinguished in any line.
5683_32865_000045_000003 I forget all the other good things he did; but he ended by shooting himself through the head in his bed room, and that was not the worst thing ever he did.'
5683_32865_000046_000000 And Wylder laughed again, and began to whistle very low-not, I fancy, for want of thought, but as a sort of accompaniment thereto, for he suddenly said-
5683_32865_000047_000000 'And where is he staying?'
5683_32865_000048_000000 'Who?--Lake?'
5683_32865_000049_000000 'Yes.'
5683_32865_000050_000000 'I don't know; but I think he mentioned Larkins's house, didn't he?
5683_32865_000050_000001 I'm not quite sure.'
5683_32865_000052_000000 And Wylder chuckled angrily, and the small change in his pocket tinkled fiercely, as his eye glanced on the graceful captain, who was entertaining the ladies, no doubt, very agreeably in the distance.
5683_32866_000002_000000 CHAPTER eleven.
5683_32866_000004_000000 Miss Lake declined the carriage to night.
5683_32866_000005_000000 'Did you see that?' said Wylder in my ear, with a chuckle; and, wagging his head, he added, rather loftily for him, 'Miss Brandon, I reckon, has taken your measure, Master Stanley, as well as i I wonder what the deuce the old dowager sees in him.
5683_32866_000005_000001 Old women always like rascals.'
5683_32866_000006_000000 And he added something still less complimentary.
5683_32866_000007_000000 I suppose the balance of attraction and repulsion was overcome by Miss Lake, much as he disliked Stanley, for Wylder followed them out with Lord Chelford, to help the young lady into her cloak and goloshes, and I found myself near Miss Brandon for the first time that evening, and much to my surprise she was first to speak, and that rather strangely.
5683_32866_000008_000000 'You seem to be very sensible, mr De Cresseron; pray tell me, frankly, what do you think of all this?'
5683_32866_000011_000000 'There can hardly be a second opinion, Miss Brandon; I think it a very wise measure,' I replied, much surprised.
5683_32866_000012_000000 'Very wise-exactly.
5683_32866_000012_000001 But don't these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly?
5683_32866_000012_000002 Do you really think your friend, mr Wylder, cares about me?'
5683_32866_000013_000000 'I take that for granted: in the nature of things it can hardly be otherwise,' I replied, a good deal startled and perplexed by the curious audacity of her interrogatory.
5683_32866_000016_000000 I was vexed with myself for having managed with so little skill a conversation which, opened so oddly and frankly, might have placed me on relations so nearly confidential, with that singular and beautiful girl. I ought to have rejoiced-but we don't always see what most concerns our peace.
5683_32866_000016_000002 She was so unreserved, it seemed, and yet in this directness there was something almost contemptuous.
5683_32866_000017_000000 By this time Lord Chelford and Wylder returned; and, disgusted rather with myself, I ruminated on my want of general ship.
5683_32866_000018_000000 In the meantime, Miss Lake, with her hand on her brother's arm, was walking swiftly under the trees of the back avenue towards that footpath which, through wild copse and broken clumps near the park, emerges upon the still darker road which passes along the wooded glen by the mills, and skirts the little paling of the recluse lady's garden.
5683_32866_000019_000000 They had not walked far, when Lake suddenly said-
5683_32866_000020_000001 'I really don't think Wylder cares twopence about her, or she about him,' and Stanley Lake laughed gently and sleepily.
5683_32866_000021_000000 'I don't think they pretend to like one another.
5683_32866_000021_000001 It is quite understood. It was all, you know, old Lady Chelford's arrangement: and Dorcas is so supine, I believe she would allow herself to be given away by anyone, and to anyone, rather than be at the least trouble.
5683_32866_000021_000002 She provokes me.'
5683_32866_000022_000000 'But I thought she liked Sir Harry Bracton: he's a good looking fellow; and Queen's Bracton is a very nice thing, you know.'
5683_32866_000023_000000 'Yes, so they said; but that would, I think, have been worse.
5683_32866_000023_000001 Something may be made of Mark Wylder.
5683_32866_000024_000000 'Why-what has Sir Harry done?
5683_32866_000024_000002 If a fellow's been a little bit wild, he's Beelzebub at once. Bracton's a very good fellow, I can assure you.'
5683_32866_000025_000000 The fact is, Captain Lake, an accomplished player, made a pretty little revenue of Sir Harry's billiards, which were wild and noisy; and liking his money, thought he liked himself-a confusion not uncommon.
5683_32866_000028_000000 'It is very happy, for her at least, they are not,' said Rachel, and a long silence ensued.
5683_32866_000029_000000 Their walk continued silent for the greater part, neither was quite satisfied with the other.
5683_32866_000029_000001 But Rachel at last said-
5683_32866_000031_000000 'I, Radie?' he answered quietly, 'why on earth should you think so?'
5683_32866_000033_000000 'Now that's impossible, Radie; for I really don't think I once thought of him all this evening-except just while we were talking.'
5683_32866_000035_000000 'Really, Radie, you're quite mistaken.
5683_32866_000035_000001 I assure you, upon my honour, I've no secret.
5683_32866_000036_000000 Miss Rachel only glanced across her mufflers on his face.
5683_32866_000036_000001 There was a bright moonlight, broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves; and the mottled lights and shadows glided oddly across his pale features.
5683_32866_000039_000001 What I say is altogether on your own account.
5683_32866_000039_000002 Mark my words, you'll find him too strong for you; aye, and too deep.
5683_32866_000039_000005 Whatever you meditate, he probably anticipates it-you know best-and you will find him prepared.
5683_32866_000039_000006 You have given him time enough.
5683_32866_000039_000007 You were always the same, close, dark, and crooked, and wise in your own conceit.
5683_32866_000040_000000 'Really, Radie, you're enough to frighten a poor fellow; you won't mind a word I say, and go on predicting all manner of mischief between me and Wylder, the very nature of which I can't surmise.
5683_32866_000040_000001 Would you dislike my smoking a cigar, Radie?'
5683_32866_000042_000000 To my mind there has always been something inexpressibly awful in family feuds.
5683_32866_000043_000001 It was one of many, opening upon the long gallery, which had been the scene, four generations back, of that unnatural and bloody midnight duel which had laid one scion of this ancient house in his shroud, and driven another a fugitive to the moral solitudes of a continental banishment.
5683_32866_000044_000002 When I heard the servant's step traversing that long gallery, as it seemed to the in haste to be gone, and when all grew quite silent, I began to feel a dismal sort of sensation, and lighted the pair of wax candles which I found upon the small writing table.
5683_32866_000045_000002 The portion of it which the carpet did not cover showed it to be oak, dark and rugged.
5683_32866_000045_000004 Its four posts were, like the rest of it, oak, well nigh black, fantastically turned and carved, with a great urn like capital and base, and shaped midway, like a gigantic lance handle.
5683_32866_000045_000005 Its curtains were of thick and faded tapestry.
5683_32866_000045_000006 I was always a lover of such antiquities, but I confess at that moment I would have vastly preferred a sprightly modern chintz and a trumpery little French bed in a corner of the Brandon Arms.
5683_32866_000045_000008 All the furniture belonged to other times.
5683_32866_000047_000001 My cigar case was a resource.
5683_32866_000047_000002 I was not a bit afraid of being found out.
5683_32866_000047_000003 I did not even take the precaution of smoking up the chimney.
5683_32866_000047_000004 I boldly lighted my cheroot.
5683_32866_000047_000005 I peeped through the dense window curtain there were no shutters.
5683_32866_000047_000008 The sombre old trees, like gigantic hearse plumes, black and awful.
5683_32866_000047_000009 The chapel lay full in view, where so many of the, strange and equivocal race, under whose ancient roof tree I then stood, were lying under their tombstones.
5683_32866_000048_000000 Somehow, I had grown nervous.
5683_32866_000048_000001 A little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney, and startled me confoundedly.
5683_32879_000002_000000 CHAPTER twenty four.
5683_32879_000003_000000 DORCAS BRANDON PAYS RACHEL A VISIT.
5683_32879_000004_000000 It was not very much past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from Brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of Redman's Farm.
5683_32879_000006_000000 'Better to day, Tamar?' enquired this grand and beautiful young lady.
5683_32879_000007_000000 The sun glimmered through the boughs behind her; her face was in shade, and its delicate chiselling was brought out in soft reflected lights; and old Tamar looked on her in a sort of wonder, her beauty seemed so celestial and splendid.
5683_32879_000008_000001 She was up and dressed, and this moment coming down, and would be very happy to see Miss Brandon, if she would step into the drawing room.
5683_32879_000009_000000 Miss Brandon took old Tamar's hand gently and pressed it.
5683_32879_000009_000001 I suppose she was glad and took this way of showing it; and tall, beautiful, graceful, in rustling silks, she glided into the tiny drawing room silently, and sate down softly by the window, looking out upon the flowers and the falling leaves, mottled in light and shadow.
5683_32879_000011_000000 So there came a step and a little rustling of feminine draperies, the small door opened, and Rachel entered, with her hand extended, and a pale smile of welcome.
5683_32879_000012_000001 But poor Rachel Lake had more than that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile.
5683_32879_000013_000000 She was sanguine, she was genial and companionable, and her spirits rose at the sight of a friendly face.
5683_32879_000014_000000 'Rachel, dear, I'm so glad to see you,' said Dorcas, placing her arms gently about her neck, and kissing her twice or thrice.
5683_32879_000014_000001 There was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner, which was new to Rachel, and comforting, and she returned the greeting as kindly, and felt more like her former self.
5683_32879_000014_000002 'You have been more ill than I thought, darling, and you are still far from quite recovered.'
5683_32879_000015_000000 Rachel's pale and sharpened features and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise.
5683_32879_000016_000000 'I shall soon be as well as I am ever likely to be-that is, quite well,' answered Rachel.
5683_32879_000016_000001 'You have been very kind.
5683_32879_000016_000002 I've heard of your coming here, and sending, so often.'
5683_32879_000017_000000 They sat down side by side, and Dorcas held her hand.
5683_32879_000018_000000 'Maybe, Rachel dear, you would like to drive a little?'
5683_32879_000019_000000 'No, darling, not yet; it is very good of you.'
5683_32879_000020_000000 'You have been so ill, my poor Rachel.'
5683_32879_000022_000000 Poor Rachel! her nature recoiled from deceit, and she told, at all events, as much of the truth as she dared.
5683_32879_000023_000000 Dorcas's large eyes rested upon her with a grave enquiry, and then Miss Brandon looked down in silence for a while on the carpet, and was thinking a little sternly, maybe, and with a look of pain, still holding Rachel's hand, she said, with a sad sort of reproach in her tone,
5683_32879_000024_000000 'Rachel, dear, you have not told my secret?'
5683_32879_000025_000000 'No, indeed, Dorcas-never, and never will; and I think, though I have learned to fear death, I would rather die than let Stanley even suspect it.'
5683_32879_000026_000000 She spoke with a sudden energy, which partook of fear and passion, and flushed her thin cheek, and made her languid eyes flash.
5683_32879_000027_000000 'Thank you, Rachel, my Cousin Rachel, my only friend.
5683_32879_000027_000001 I ought not to have doubted you,' and she kissed her again.
5683_32879_000027_000002 'Chelford had a note from mr Wylder this morning-another note-his coming delayed, and something of his having to see some person who is abroad,' continued Dorcas, after a little pause.
5683_32879_000027_000003 'You have heard, of course, of mr Wylder's absence?'
5683_32879_000029_000001 I meant to speak to him and end all between us; and I would now write, but there is no address to his letters.
5683_32879_000029_000002 I think Lady Chelford and her son begin to think there is more in this oddly timed journey of mr Wylder's than first appeared. When I came into the parlour this morning I knew they were speaking of it.
5683_32879_000029_000003 If he does not return in a day or two, Chelford, I am sure, will speak to me, and then I shall tell him my resolution.'
5683_32879_000030_000000 'Yes,' said Rachel.
5683_32879_000031_000000 'I don't understand his absence.
5683_32879_000033_000000 'I don't think, Rachel dear, you heard me?' said Dorcas.
5683_32879_000034_000000 'Can I conjecture why he is gone?' murmured Rachel, still gazing with a wild kind of apathy into distance.
5683_32879_000034_000002 Yes, we sometimes conjecture right, and sometimes wrong; there are many things best not conjectured about at all-some interesting, some abominable, some that pass all comprehension: I never mean to conjecture, if I can help it, again.'
5683_32879_000035_000000 And the wan oracle having spoken, she sate down in the same sort of abstraction again beside Dorcas, and she looked full in her cousin's eyes.
5683_32879_000036_000000 'I made you a voluntary promise, Dorcas, and now you will make me one.
5683_32879_000036_000001 Of Mark Wylder I say this: his name has been for years hateful to me, and recently it has become frightful; and you will promise me simply this, that you will never ask me to speak again about him.
5683_32879_000036_000002 Be he near, or be he far, I regard his very name with horror.'
5683_32879_000037_000000 Dorcas returned her gaze with one of haughty amazement; and Rachel said,
5683_32879_000040_000000 'Dorcas, you are changed; have I lost your love for asking so poor a kindness?'
5683_32879_000041_000000 'I'm only disappointed, Rachel; I thought you would have trusted me, as I did you.'
5683_32879_000042_000000 'It is an antipathy-an antipathy I cannot get over, dear Dorcas; you may think it a madness, but don't blame me.
5683_32879_000042_000001 Remember I am neither well nor happy, and forgive what you cannot like in me.
5683_32879_000042_000002 I have very few to love me now, and I thought you might love me, as I have begun to love you.
5683_32879_000042_000003 Oh! Dorcas, darling, don't forsake me; I am very lonely here and my spirits are gone and I never needed kindness so much before.'
5683_32879_000043_000000 And she threw her arms round her cousin's neck, and brave Rachel at last burst into tears.
5683_32879_000044_000000 Dorcas, in her strange way, was moved.
5683_32879_000045_000000 'I like you still, Rachel; I'm sure I'll always like you.
5683_32879_000045_000001 You resemble me, Rachel: you are fearless and inflexible and generous.
5683_32879_000045_000002 That spirit belongs to the blood of our strange race; all our women were so.
5683_32879_000045_000003 Yes, Rachel, I do love you.
5683_32879_000045_000004 I was wounded to find you had thoughts you would not trust to me; but I have made the promise, and I'll keep it; and I love you all the same.'
5683_32879_000046_000000 'Thank you, Dorcas, dear.
5683_32879_000046_000001 I like to call you cousin-kindred is so pleasant.
5683_32879_000046_000002 Thank you, from my heart, for your love; you will never know, perhaps, how much it is to me.'
5683_32879_000047_000000 The young queen looked on her kindly, but sadly, through her large, strange eyes, clouded with a presage of futurity, and she kissed her again, and said-
5683_32879_000048_000000 'Rachel, dear, I have a plan for you and me: we shall be old maids, you and I, and live together like the ladies of Llangollen, careless and happy recluses.
5683_32879_000048_000001 I'll let Brandon and abdicate.
5683_32879_000048_000002 We will make a little tour together, when all this shall have blown over, in a few weeks, and choose our retreat; and with the winter's snow we'll vanish from Brandon, and appear with the early flowers at our cottage among the beautiful woods and hills of Wales.
5683_32879_000048_000003 Will you come, Rachel?'
5683_32879_000049_000000 At sight of this castle or cottage in the air, Rachel lighted up.
5683_32879_000049_000002 It was escape-flight from Gylingden-flight from Brandon-flight from Redman's Farm: they and all their hated associations would be far behind, and that awful page in her story, not torn out, indeed, but gummed down as it were, and no longer glaring and glowering in her eyes every moment of her waking life.
5683_32879_000050_000001 It was a hope.
5683_32879_000050_000002 She seized it; she clung to it.
5764_299665_000000_000001 Afterward it was supposed that he was satisfied with the blood of oxen, lambs and doves, and that in exchange for or on account of these sacrifices, this God gave rain, sunshine and harvest.
5764_299665_000000_000002 It was also believed that if the sacrifices were not made, this God sent pestilence, famine, flood and earthquake.
5764_299665_000001_000000 The last phase of this belief in sacrifice was, according to the Christian doctrine, that God accepted the blood of his son, and that after his son had been murdered, he, God, was satisfied, and wanted no more blood.
5764_299665_000002_000000 During all these years and by all these peoples it was believed that this God heard and answered prayer, that he forgave sins and saved the souls of true believers.
5764_299665_000002_000001 This, in a general way, is the definition of religion.
5764_299665_000003_000000 Now, the questions are, Whether religion was founded on any known fact?
5764_299665_000003_000001 Whether such a being as God exists?
5764_299665_000003_000002 Whether he was the creator of yourself and myself?
5764_299665_000003_000003 Whether any prayer was ever answered?
5764_299665_000003_000004 Whether any sacrifice of babe or ox secured the favor of this unseen God?
5764_299665_000005_000000 Why did he create the intellectually inferior?
5764_299665_000006_000000 Why did he create the deformed and helpless?
5764_299665_000007_000000 Why did he create the criminal, the idiotic, the insane?
5764_299665_000008_000000 Can infinite wisdom and power make any excuse for the creation of failures?
5764_299665_000009_000000 Are the failures under obligation to their creator?
5764_299665_000011_000000 Is he responsible for all the chiefs, kings, emperors, and queens?
5764_299665_000012_000000 Is he responsible for all the wars that have been waged, for all the innocent blood that has been shed?
5764_299665_000013_000000 Is he responsible for the centuries of slavery, for the backs that have been scarred with the lash, for the babes that have been sold from the breasts of mothers, for the families that have been separated and destroyed?
5764_299665_000016_000000 Did he allow his enemies to torture and burn his friends?
5764_299665_000019_000000 Can we conceive of a devil base enough to prefer his enemies to his friends?
5764_299665_000020_000000 If a good and infinitely powerful God governs this world, how can we account for cyclones, earthquakes, pestilence and famine?
5764_299665_000021_000000 How can we account for cancers, for microbes, for diphtheria and the thousand diseases that prey on infancy?
5764_299665_000025_000000 Did infinite goodness fashion the wings of the eagles so that their fleeing prey could be overtaken?
5764_299665_000026_000000 Did infinite goodness create the beasts of prey with the intention that they should devour the weak and helpless?
5764_299665_000027_000000 Did infinite goodness create the countless worthless living things that breed within and feed upon the flesh of higher forms?
5764_299665_000028_000000 Did infinite wisdom intentionally produce the microscopic beasts that feed upon the optic nerve?
5764_299665_000029_000000 Think of blinding a man to satisfy the appetite of a microbe!
5764_299665_000030_000001 Think of the victims!
5764_299665_000030_000002 Think of the Niagara of blood pouring over the precipice of cruelty!
5764_299665_000031_000000 In view of these facts, what, after all, is religion?
5764_299665_000032_000000 It is fear.
5764_299665_000035_000000 Fear bends the knees and utters the prayer.
5764_299665_000036_000000 Fear pretends to love.
5764_299665_000037_000000 Religion teaches the slave virtues-obedience, humility, self denial, forgiveness, non resistance.
5764_299665_000038_000000 Lips, religious and fearful, tremblingly repeat this passage: "Though he slay me, yet will I trust him." This is the abyss of degradation.
5764_299665_000039_000000 Religion does not teach self reliance, independence, manliness, courage, self defence.
5764_299665_000039_000001 Religion makes God a master and man his serf.
5764_299665_000039_000002 The master cannot be great enough to make slavery sweet.
5764_299665_000041_000003 He caused the sun to rise, to steal all moisture from the land, but gave no rain.
5764_299665_000041_000004 He saw the seeds that man had planted wither and perish, but he sent no rain.
5764_299665_000041_000005 He saw the people look with sad eyes upon the barren earth, and he sent no rain.
5764_299665_000041_000007 Can we say that in the heart of this God there blossomed the flower of pity?
5764_299665_000041_000008 Can we say that he cared for the children of men?
5764_299665_000042_000001 Do we prove his goodness by showing that he has opened the earth and swallowed thousands of his helpless children, or that with the volcanoes he has overwhelmed them with rivers of fire? Can we infer the goodness of God from the facts we know?
5764_299665_000043_000000 If these calamities did not happen, would we suspect that God cared nothing for human beings?
5764_299665_000043_000001 If there were no famine, no pestilence, no cyclone, no earthquake, would we think that God is not good?
5764_299665_000044_000000 According to the theologians, God did not make all men alike.
5764_299665_000044_000002 Was there goodness, was there wisdom in this?
5764_299665_000045_000001 If we say yes, then I ask another question: Should the inferior races thank God that they are not superior, or should they thank God that they are not beasts?
5764_299665_000046_000000 When God made these different races he knew that the superior would enslave the inferior, knew that the inferior would be conquered, and finally destroyed.
5764_299665_000048_000000 Why, then, should we say that God is good?
5764_299665_000050_000001 THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
5764_299665_000051_000000 MOST people cling to the supernatural.
5764_299665_000051_000001 If they give up one God, they imagine another.
5764_299665_000051_000002 Having outgrown Jehovah, they talk about the power that works for righteousness.
5764_299665_000052_000000 What is this power?
5764_299665_000053_000000 Man advances, and necessarily advances through experience.
5764_299665_000053_000001 A man wishing to go to a certain place comes to where the road divides.
5764_299665_000053_000002 He takes the left hand, believing it to be the right road, and travels until he finds that it is the wrong one.
5764_299665_000053_000003 He retraces his steps and takes the right hand road and reaches the place desired.
5764_299665_000053_000004 The next time he goes to the same place, he does not take the left hand road.
5764_299665_000053_000005 He has tried that road, and knows that it is the wrong road.
5764_299665_000054_000001 The hand is burned, and after that the child keeps its hand out of the fire.
5764_299665_000055_000002 It has no will, no purpose.
5764_299665_000055_000003 It is a result.
5764_299665_000056_000000 So thousands have endeavored to establish the existence of God by the fact that we have what is called the moral sense; that is to say, a conscience.
5764_299665_000057_000000 It is insisted by these theologians, and by many of the so-called philosophers, that this moral sense, this sense of duty, of obligation, was imported, and that conscience is an exotic.
5764_299665_000057_000001 Taking the ground that it was not produced here, was not produced by man, they then imagine a God from whom it came.
5764_299665_000058_000000 Man is a social being.
5764_299665_000058_000001 We live together in families, tribes and nations.
5764_299665_000059_000000 The members of a family, of a tribe, of a nation, who increase the happiness of the family, of the tribe or of the nation, are considered good members.
5764_299665_000059_000001 They are praised, admired and respected.
5764_299665_000059_000002 They are regarded as good; that is to say, as moral.
5764_299665_000060_000000 The members who add to the misery of the family, the tribe or the nation, are considered bad members.
5764_299665_000061_000000 They are blamed, despised, punished.
5764_299665_000061_000001 They are regarded as immoral.
5764_299665_000062_000000 The family, the tribe, the nation, creates a standard of conduct, of morality.
5764_299665_000062_000001 There is nothing supernatural in this.
5764_299665_000063_000000 The greatest of human beings has said, "Conscience is born of love."
5764_299665_000064_000000 The sense of obligation, of duty, was naturally produced.
5764_299665_000065_000000 Among savages, the immediate consequences of actions are taken into consideration.
5764_299665_000065_000001 As people advance, the remote consequences are perceived. The standard of conduct becomes higher.
5764_299665_000065_000002 The imagination is cultivated. A man puts himself in the place of another.
5764_299665_000065_000003 The sense of duty becomes stronger, more imperative.
5764_299665_000065_000004 Man judges himself.
5764_299665_000067_000000 Man has deceived himself.
5764_299665_000069_000000 Suppose that an infinite God exists, what can we do for him?
5764_299665_000069_000001 Being infinite, he is conditionless; being conditionless, he cannot be benefited or injured.
5764_299665_000069_000002 He cannot want.
5764_299665_000070_000000 Think of the egotism of a man who believes that an infinite being wants his praise!
5764_299665_000072_000000 WHAT has our religion done?
5764_299665_000072_000001 Of course, it is admitted by Christians that all other religions are false, and consequently we need examine only our own.
5764_299665_000073_000000 Has Christianity done good?
5764_299665_000073_000001 Has it made men nobler, more merciful, nearer honest?
5764_299665_000073_000002 When the church had control, were men made better and happier?
5764_299665_000074_000000 What has been the effect of Christianity in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal, in Ireland?
5764_299665_000075_000001 What was the effect of Christianity in Switzerland, in Holland, in Scotland, in England, in America?
5764_299665_000075_000002 Let us be honest.
5764_299665_000075_000003 Could these countries have been worse without religion?
5764_299665_000075_000004 Could they have been worse had they had any other religion than Christianity?
5764_299665_000076_000000 Would Torquemada have been worse had he been a follower of Zoroaster? Would Calvin have been more bloodthirsty if he had believed in the religion of the South Sea Islanders?
5764_299665_000076_000002 Would john Knox have been any worse had he deserted Christ and become a follower of Confucius?
5764_299665_000077_000000 Take our own dear, merciful Puritan Fathers?
5764_299665_000077_000001 What did Christianity do for them?
5764_299665_000077_000002 They hated pleasure.
5764_299665_000077_000003 On the door of life they hung the crape of death.
5764_299665_000077_000004 They muffled all the bells of gladness.
5764_299665_000077_000005 They made cradles by putting rockers on coffins.
5764_299665_000077_000006 In the Puritan year there were twelve Decembers.
5764_299665_000077_000007 They tried to do away with infancy and youth, with prattle of babes and the song of the morning.
5764_299665_000078_000000 The religion of the Puritan was an unadulterated curse.
5764_299665_000078_000002 Would the Puritan have been worse if he had adopted the religion of the North American Indians?
5764_299665_000081_000000 In this incident we see the real spirit of Protestant lovers of the Bible.
5764_299665_000081_000001 In other words, it was just as fiendish, just as infamous as the Catholic spirit.
5764_299665_000082_000000 Has the Bible made the people of Georgia kind and merciful?
5764_299665_000082_000001 Would the lynchers be more ferocious if they worshiped gods of wood and stone?
5764_299665_000084_000000 RELIGION has been tried, and in all countries, in all times, has failed.
5764_299665_000085_000000 Religion has never made man merciful.
5764_299665_000086_000000 Remember the Inquisition.
5764_299665_000090_000000 Religion has never made man free.
5764_299665_000091_000000 It has never made man moral, temperate, industrious and honest.
5764_299665_000092_000000 Are Christians more temperate, nearer virtuous, nearer honest than savages?
5764_299665_000093_000000 Among savages do we not find that their vices and cruelties are the fruits of their superstitions?
5764_299665_000094_000000 To those who believe in the Uniformity of Nature, religion is impossible.
5764_299665_000095_000000 Can we affect the nature and qualities of substance by prayer?
5764_299665_000095_000001 Can we hasten or delay the tides by worship?
5764_299665_000095_000002 Can we change winds by sacrifice? Will kneelings give us wealth?
5764_299665_000095_000003 Can we cure disease by supplication?
5764_299665_000095_000004 Can we add to our knowledge by ceremony?
5764_299665_000095_000005 Can we receive virtue or honor as alms?
5764_299665_000096_000001 Is not what we call mind just as natural as what we call body?
5764_299665_000097_000000 Religion rests on the idea that Nature has a master and that this master will listen to prayer; that this master punishes and rewards; that he loves praise and flattery and hates the brave and free.
5764_299665_000098_000000 Has man obtained any help from heaven?
5764_299665_000100_000000 IF we have a theory, we must have facts for the foundation.
5764_299665_000100_000001 We must have corner stones.
5764_299665_000100_000002 We must not build on guesses, fancies, analogies or inferences.
5764_299665_000100_000003 The structure must have a basement.
5764_299665_000100_000004 If we build, we must begin at the bottom.
5764_299665_000101_000000 I have a theory and I have four corner stones.
5764_299665_000102_000000 The first stone is that matter-substance-cannot be destroyed, cannot be annihilated.
5764_299665_000103_000000 The second stone is that force cannot be destroyed, cannot be annihilated.
5764_299665_000104_000000 The third stone is that matter and force cannot exist apart-no matter without force-no force without matter.
5764_299665_000105_000000 The fourth stone is that that which cannot be destroyed could not have been created; that the indestructible is the uncreatable.
5764_299665_000107_000000 It follows that nothing has been or can be created; that there never has been or can be a creator.
5764_299665_000108_000000 It follows that there could not have been any intelligence, any design back of matter and force.
5764_299665_000109_000000 There is no intelligence without force.
5764_299665_000109_000002 Consequently there could not by any possibility have been any intelligence, any force, back of matter.
5764_299665_000110_000000 It therefore follows that the supernatural does not and cannot exist.
5764_299665_000110_000003 In other words, it proves that man has never received any help from heaven; that all sacrifices have been in vain, and that all prayers have died unanswered in the heedless air.
5764_299665_000110_000004 I do not pretend to know.
5764_299665_000110_000005 I say what I think.
5764_299665_000112_000000 In the universe there is no chance, no caprice.
5764_299665_000113_000000 That which has not happened, could not.
5764_299665_000113_000001 The present is the necessary product of all the past, the necessary cause of all the future.
5764_299665_000114_000001 The form and motion of every star, the climate of every world, all forms of vegetable and animal life, all instinct, intelligence and conscience, all assertions and denials, all vices and virtues, all thoughts and dreams, all hopes and fears, are necessities.
5764_299665_000114_000002 Not one of the countless things and relations in the universe could have been different.
5764_299665_000118_000000 We now know that our first parents were not foreigners.
5764_299665_000118_000002 We now know, if we know anything, that the universe is natural, and that men and women have been naturally produced.
5764_299665_000118_000003 We now know our ancestors, our pedigree.
5764_299665_000118_000004 We have the family tree.
5764_299665_000119_000000 We have all the links of the chain, twenty six links inclusive from moner to man.
5764_299665_000120_000000 We did not get our information from inspired books.
5764_299665_000120_000001 We have fossil facts and living forms.
5764_299665_000122_000000 We know the paths that life has traveled.
5764_299665_000122_000001 We know the footsteps of advance.
5764_299665_000122_000002 They have been traced.
5764_299665_000122_000003 The last link has been found.
5764_299665_000124_000001 Reform.
5764_299665_000125_000000 FOR thousands of years men and women have been trying to reform the world.
5764_299665_000126_000001 I will tell them why.
5764_299665_000127_000000 Ignorance, poverty and vice are populating the world.
5764_299665_000127_000001 The gutter is a nursery.
5764_299665_000127_000003 They depend on the Lord, on luck and charity.
5764_299665_000127_000004 They are not intelligent enough to think about consequences or to feel responsibility.
5764_299665_000127_000005 At the same time they do not want children, because a child is a curse, a curse to them and to itself.
5764_299665_000127_000006 The babe is not welcome, because it is a burden.
5764_299665_000127_000007 These unwelcome children fill the jails and prisons, the asylums and hospitals, and they crowd the scaffolds.
5764_299665_000127_000009 They live by fraud and violence, and bequeath their vices to their children.
5764_299665_000129_000000 Failure seems to be the trademark of Nature.
5764_299665_000129_000001 Why?
5764_299665_000129_000002 Nature has no design, no intelligence.
5764_299665_000129_000003 Nature produces without purpose, sustains without intention and destroys without thought.
5764_299665_000129_000004 Man has a little intelligence, and he should use it.
5764_299665_000129_000005 Intelligence is the only lever capable of raising mankind.
5764_299665_000132_000000 Must the world forever remain the victim of ignorant passion?
5764_299665_000132_000001 Can the world be civilized to that degree that consequences will be taken into consideration by all?
5764_299665_000133_000000 Why should men and women have children that they cannot take care of, children that are burdens and curses?
5764_299665_000133_000001 Why?
5764_299665_000133_000002 Because they have more passion than intelligence, more passion than conscience, more passion than reason.
5764_299665_000134_000000 You cannot reform these people with tracts and talk.
5764_299665_000134_000001 You cannot reform these people with preach and creed.
5764_299665_000134_000002 Passion is, and always has been, deaf.
5764_299665_000134_000003 These weapons of reform are substantially useless.
5764_299665_000134_000004 Criminals, tramps, beggars and failures are increasing every day.
5764_299665_000134_000005 The prisons, jails, poorhouses and asylums are crowded.
5764_299665_000134_000006 Religion is helpless.
5764_299665_000134_000008 The tide of vice is rising.
5764_299665_000135_000001 Ignorance, poverty and vice must stop populating the world.
5764_299665_000135_000002 This cannot be done by moral suasion.
5764_299665_000135_000003 This cannot be done by talk or example.
5764_299665_000135_000005 This cannot be done by force, physical or moral.
5764_299665_000136_000000 To accomplish this there is but one way.
5764_299665_000136_000001 Science must make woman the owner, the mistress of herself.
5764_299665_000136_000002 Science, the only possible savior of mankind, must put it in the power of woman to decide for herself whether she will or will not become a mother.
5764_299665_000137_000000 This is the solution of the whole question.
5764_299665_000137_000002 The babes that are then born will be welcome.
5764_299665_000137_000003 They will be clasped with glad hands to happy breasts.
5764_299665_000137_000004 They will fill homes with light and joy.
5764_299665_000138_000000 Men and women who believe that slaves are purer, truer, than the free, who believe that fear is a safer guide than knowledge, that only those are really good who obey the commands of others, and that ignorance is the soil in which the perfect, perfumed flower of virtue grows, will with protesting hands hide their shocked faces.
5764_299665_000139_000000 Men and women who think that light is the enemy of virtue, that purity dwells in darkness, that it is dangerous for human beings to know themselves and the facts in Nature that affect their well being, will be horrified at the thought of making intelligence the master of passion.
5764_299665_000141_000000 When that time comes the prison walls will fall, the dungeons will be flooded with light, and the shadow of the scaffold will cease to curse the earth.
5764_299665_000141_000001 Poverty and crime will be childless.
5764_299665_000141_000002 The withered hands of want will not be stretched for alms.
5764_299665_000141_000003 They will be dust.
5764_299665_000143_000000 RELIGION can never reform mankind because religion is slavery.
6070_63485_000003_000000 CHAPTER seven.
6070_63485_000005_000002 His steps, which were somewhat irregular, in consequence of the frequent libations of the evening, were soon unheard amidst the whistling of the storm and the sheets of rain which dashed against the walls.
6070_63485_000006_000000 "They're done for," said the Schoolmaster, in a low key, to the Chouette; "out with your vitriol, and mind your eye."
6070_63485_000007_000000 "Let us take off our shoes, and then they won't hear us as we follow," suggested the Chouette.
6070_63485_000009_000000 The two monsters took off their shoes, and moved stealthily along, keeping in the shadows of the houses.
6070_63485_000009_000001 By means of this stratagem they followed so closely, that, although within a few steps of Sarah and Tom, they did not hear them.
6070_63485_000010_000001 Are you not cold, Sarah?"
6070_63485_000011_000000 "Perhaps we shall glean something from this smuggler,--this Bras Rouge," said Sarah, in a thoughtful tone, and not replying to her brother's inquiry.
6070_63485_000012_000001 We must turn back."
6070_63485_000014_000000 "I am glad they have gone that way," said the Schoolmaster, "for if the 'cove' resists, I have my own idea."
6070_63485_000015_000001 In an instant, the Schoolmaster, with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger, seized Seyton with one hand by the throat, and exclaimed, "Your money, or I will fling you into this hole!"
6070_63485_000016_000000 Then the brigand, pushing Seyton backwards, shoved him off his balance, and with one hand held him suspended over the mouth of the deep excavation; whilst, with his other hand, he grasped the arm of Sarah, as if in a vice.
6070_63485_000016_000001 Before Tom could make the slightest struggle, the Chouette had emptied his pockets with singular dexterity.
6070_63485_000017_000001 No," said the old brute, grumblingly, "no, not one ring.
6070_63485_000017_000002 What a shame!"
6070_63485_000018_000000 Tom Seyton did not lose his presence of mind during this scene, rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred.
6070_63485_000019_000000 "Will you strike a bargain?
6070_63485_000019_000001 My pocketbook contains papers quite useless to you; return it to me, and to morrow I will give you twenty five louis d'ors," said Tom to the Schoolmaster, whose hand relaxed something of its fierce gripe.
6070_63485_000020_000001 "Be off, without looking behind you, and be thankful that you have escaped so well."
6070_63485_000021_000000 "One moment," said the Chouette; "if he behaves well, he shall have his pocketbook.
6070_63485_000022_000000 "I do."
6070_63485_000024_000000 "Yes."
6070_63485_000025_000000 "Opposite saint Ouen, at the end of the road of La Revolte, the plain is wide and open.
6070_63485_000025_000001 Across the fields, one may see a long way.
6070_63485_000025_000003 Hand me the cash, and I will hand you the pocketbook."
6070_63485_000026_000000 "But he'll trap you, Chouette."
6070_63485_000027_000000 "Oh, no, he won't; I'm up to him or any of his dodges.
6070_63485_000027_000001 We can see a long way off.
6070_63485_000027_000002 I have only one eye, but that is a piercer; and if the 'cove' comes with a companion, he won't find anybody; I shall have 'mizzled.'"
6070_63485_000028_000000 A sudden idea seemed to strike Sarah, and she said to the brigand, "Will you like to gain some money?"
6070_63485_000029_000000 "Yes."
6070_63485_000031_000000 "A dandy with moustaches?
6070_63485_000031_000001 Yes, I would have stuck it into the fellow, but he did not give me time.
6070_63485_000031_000002 He stunned me with two blows of his fists, and upset me on the table,--for the first time that any man ever did so. Curses on him! but I will be revenged."
6070_63485_000034_000000 "Wretch!
6070_63485_000034_000001 I do not seek his life," replied Sarah to the Schoolmaster.
6070_63485_000035_000000 "What, then, would you have?"
6070_63485_000036_000001 I will not give you one thousand, but two thousand, francs, if you succeed."
6070_63485_000037_000001 I would go, if I were you.
6070_63485_000037_000002 Fire and smoke!
6070_63485_000037_000003 Old boy, it will pay for looking after."
6070_63485_000039_000000 "Be it so; to morrow at one."
6070_63485_000040_000000 "At one o'clock."
6070_63485_000044_000000 "Agreed."
6070_63485_000045_000000 "I will bring your pocketbook."
6070_63485_000046_000000 "And you shall have the five hundred francs I promised you, and we will agree in the other matter, if you are reasonable."
6070_63485_000047_000001 Do not follow us, or else-"
6070_63485_000049_000000 A concealed witness had been present at this transaction; it was the Chourineur, who had entered the cellars of the house to get shelter from the rain.
6070_63485_000049_000001 The proposal which Sarah made to the brigand respecting Rodolph deeply interested the Chourineur, who, alarmed for the perils which appeared about to beset his new friend, regretted that he could not warn him of them.
6070_63485_000049_000002 Perhaps his detestation of the Schoolmaster and the Chouette might have something to do with this feeling.
6070_63485_000050_000000 The Chourineur resolved to inform Rodolph of the danger which threatened him; but how?
6070_63485_000050_000001 He had forgotten the address of the self styled fan painter.
6070_63485_000051_000001 The Chourineur got up behind, and at one o'clock it stopped on the Boulevard de l'Observatoire, and Thomas and Sarah went down a narrow entrance, which was close at hand.
6070_86744_000001_000000 The first words that Albert uttered to his friend, on the following morning, contained a request that Franz would accompany him on a visit to the count; true, the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening; but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged.
6070_86744_000002_000000 "My very good friend and excellent neighbor," replied the count, with a smile, "you really exaggerate my trifling exertions.
6070_86744_000003_000000 "Upon my word," said Albert, "I deserve no credit for what I could not help, namely, a determination to take everything as I found it, and to let those bandits see, that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world, there is no nation but the French that can smile even in the face of grim Death himself.
6070_86744_000004_000000 "Monsieur de Morcerf," replied the count, "your offer, far from surprising me, is precisely what I expected from you, and I accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made;--nay, I will go still further, and say that I had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands."
6070_86744_000005_000000 "Oh, pray name it."
6070_86744_000006_000000 "I am wholly a stranger to Paris-it is a city I have never yet seen."
6070_86744_000007_000000 "Is it possible," exclaimed Albert, "that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world?
6070_86744_000009_000000 "So distinguished an individual as yourself," cried Albert, "could scarcely have required an introduction."
6070_86744_000012_000000 "Connected by marriage, you mean," said Franz, laughingly.
6070_86744_000013_000001 Perhaps by the time you return to Paris, I shall be quite a sober, staid father of a family!
6070_86744_000013_000003 But as regards your wish to visit our fine city, my dear count, I can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please."
6070_86744_000015_000000 "I pledge you my honor," returned the count, "that I mean to do as I have said; both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit Paris."
6070_86744_000016_000000 "When do you propose going thither?"
6070_86744_000017_000000 "Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?"
6070_86744_000018_000000 "Certainly I have; in a fortnight or three weeks' time, that is to say, as fast as I can get there!"
6070_86744_000019_000000 "Nay," said the Count; "I will give you three months ere I join you; you see I make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties.
6070_86744_000020_000000 "And in three months' time," said Albert, "you will be at my house?"
6070_86744_000022_000000 "Day for day, hour for hour," said Albert; "that will suit me to a dot."
6070_86744_000023_000000 "So be it, then," replied the count, and extending his hand towards a calendar, suspended near the chimney piece, he said, "to day is the twenty first of February;" and drawing out his watch, added, "it is exactly half past ten o'clock.
6070_86744_000024_000000 "Capital," exclaimed Albert; "your breakfast shall be waiting."
6070_86744_000025_000000 "Where do you live?"
6070_86744_000027_000000 "Have you bachelor's apartments there?
6070_86744_000027_000001 I hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience."
6070_86744_000028_000000 "I reside in my father's house, but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the court yard, entirely separated from the main building."
6070_86744_000030_000000 "Now then," said the count, returning his tablets to his pocket, "make yourself perfectly easy; the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself."
6070_86744_000031_000000 "Shall I see you again ere my departure?" asked Albert.
6070_86744_000032_000000 "That depends; when do you leave?"
6070_86744_000033_000000 "To morrow evening, at five o'clock."
6070_86744_000034_000000 "In that case I must say adieu to you, as I am compelled to go to Naples, and shall not return hither before Saturday evening or Sunday morning.
6070_86744_000035_000000 "Yes."
6070_86744_000036_000000 "For France?"
6070_86744_000037_000000 "No, for Venice; I shall remain in Italy for another year or two."
6070_86744_000038_000000 "Then we shall not meet in Paris?"
6070_86744_000039_000000 "I fear I shall not have that honor."
6070_86744_000041_000001 The young men then rose, and bowing to the count, quitted the room.
6070_86744_000041_000002 "What is the matter?" asked Albert of Franz, when they had returned to their own apartments; "you seem more than commonly thoughtful."
6070_86744_000042_000000 "I will confess to you, Albert," replied Franz, "the count is a very singular person, and the appointment you have made to meet him in Paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions."
6070_86744_000043_000001 Why, you must have lost your senses."
6070_86744_000044_000000 "Whether I am in my senses or not," answered Franz, "that is the way I feel."
6070_86744_000045_000001 Have you anything particular against him?"
6070_86744_000046_000000 "Possibly."
6070_86744_000047_000000 "Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?"
6070_86744_000048_000000 "I have."
6070_86744_000049_000000 "And where?"
6070_86744_000051_000000 "I promise."
6070_86744_000052_000000 "Upon your honor?"
6070_86744_000053_000000 "Upon my honor."
6070_86744_000054_000002 Then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the Colosseum, between the count and Vampa, in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit Peppino,--an engagement which, as our readers are aware, he most faithfully fulfilled.
6070_86744_000054_000003 At last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night, and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required, and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed.
6070_86744_000054_000004 Albert listened with the most profound attention.
6070_86744_000054_000005 "Well," said he, when Franz had concluded, "what do you find to object to in all you have related?
6070_86744_000054_000006 The count is fond of travelling, and, being rich, possesses a vessel of his own.
6070_86744_000055_000000 "But," said Franz, "the Corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel?"
6070_86744_000056_000000 "Why, really the thing seems to me simple enough.
6070_86744_000057_000000 "Still," persisted Franz, "I suppose you will allow that such men as Vampa and his band are regular villains, who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person.
6070_86744_000057_000001 How do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians?"
6070_86744_000059_000001 Certainly these are questions that, in your place, I should like to have answered."
6070_86744_000060_000000 "My dear Franz," replied Albert, "when, upon receipt of my letter, you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance, you promptly went to him, saying, 'My friend Albert de Morcerf is in danger; help me to deliver him.' Was not that nearly what you said?"
6070_86744_000061_000000 "It was."
6070_86744_000062_000001 what are his means of existence?
6070_86744_000063_000000 "I confess he asked me none."
6070_86744_000064_000000 "No; he merely came and freed me from the hands of Signor Vampa, where, I can assure you, in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern, I did not very particularly care to remain.
6070_86744_000064_000001 Now, then, Franz, when, for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered, he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any Russian prince or Italian nobleman who may pass through Paris-merely to introduce him into society-would you have me refuse?
6070_86744_000065_000000 "Well," said Franz with a sigh, "do as you please my dear viscount, for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation.
6070_86744_000065_000001 Still, in spite of all, you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular personage."
6070_86744_000066_000000 "He is a philanthropist," answered the other; "and no doubt his motive in visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize, given, as you are aware, to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity.
6070_86744_000066_000001 If my vote and interest can obtain it for him, I will readily give him the one and promise the other.
6070_86744_000066_000002 And now, my dear Franz, let us talk of something else.
6070_86744_000066_000003 Come, shall we take our luncheon, and then pay a last visit to saint Peter's?" Franz silently assented; and the following afternoon, at half past five o'clock, the young men parted.
6070_86744_000066_000004 Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris, and Franz d'Epinay to pass a fortnight at Venice.
6070_86745_000000_000001 The Guests.
6070_86745_000001_000002 Two windows only of the pavilion faced the street; three other windows looked into the court, and two at the back into the garden.
6070_86745_000002_000003 It was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built, so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt; but the well oiled hinges and locks told quite another story.
6070_86745_000002_000005 At the end of a long corridor, with which the door communicated, and which formed the ante chamber, was, on the right, Albert's breakfast room, looking into the court, and on the left the salon, looking into the garden.
6070_86745_000002_000006 Shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows, and hid from the garden and court these two apartments, the only rooms into which, as they were on the ground floor, the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate.
6070_86745_000002_000007 On the floor above were similar rooms, with the addition of a third, formed out of the ante chamber; these three rooms were a salon, a boudoir, and a bedroom.
6070_86745_000002_000008 The salon down stairs was only an Algerian divan, for the use of smokers.
6070_86745_000002_000013 What these stuffs did there, it was impossible to say; they awaited, while gratifying the eyes, a destination unknown to their owner himself; in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections.
6070_86745_000002_000015 On the walls, over the doors, on the ceiling, were swords, daggers, Malay creeses, maces, battle axes; gilded, damasked, and inlaid suits of armor; dried plants, minerals, and stuffed birds, their flame colored wings outspread in motionless flight, and their beaks forever open.
6070_86745_000002_000016 This was Albert's favorite lounging place.
6070_86745_000003_000000 However, the morning of the appointment, the young man had established himself in the small salon down stairs.
6070_86745_000003_000005 "How did these letters come?" said he.
6070_86745_000004_000000 "One by the post, Madame Danglars' footman left the other."
6070_86745_000005_000000 "Let Madame Danglars know that I accept the place she offers me in her box.
6070_86745_000005_000001 Wait; then, during the day, tell Rosa that when I leave the Opera I will sup with her as she wishes.
6070_86745_000005_000002 Take her six bottles of different wine-Cyprus, sherry, and Malaga, and a barrel of Ostend oysters; get them at Borel's, and be sure you say they are for me."
6070_86745_000007_000000 "What time is it now?"
6070_86745_000008_000000 "A quarter to ten."
6070_86745_000009_000000 "Very well, at half past ten.
6070_86745_000009_000002 Is the countess up yet?"
6070_86745_000010_000000 "If you wish, I will inquire."
6070_86745_000011_000000 "Yes, ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets, mine is incomplete; and tell her I shall have the honor of seeing her about three o'clock, and that I request permission to introduce some one to her." The valet left the room.
6070_86745_000011_000004 What do I say?
6070_86745_000011_000005 punctuality!
6070_86745_000011_000006 You, whom I expected last, you arrive at five minutes to ten, when the time fixed was half past!
6070_86745_000011_000007 Has the ministry resigned?"
6070_86745_000012_000000 "No, my dear fellow," returned the young man, seating himself on the divan; "reassure yourself; we are tottering always, but we never fall, and I begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility, and then the affairs of the Peninsula will completely consolidate us."
6070_86745_000013_000000 "Ah, true; you drive Don Carlos out of Spain."
6070_86745_000014_000000 "No, no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans.
6070_86745_000017_000000 "And you another order, for I see you have a blue ribbon at your button hole."
6070_86745_000018_000000 "Yes; they sent me the order of Charles the third.," returned Debray, carelessly.
6070_86745_000019_000000 "Come, do not affect indifference, but confess you were pleased to have it."
6070_86745_000020_000000 "Oh, it is very well as a finish to the toilet.
6070_86745_000020_000001 It looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up."
6070_86745_000021_000000 "And makes you resemble the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Reichstadt."
6070_86745_000022_000000 "It is for that reason you see me so early."
6070_86745_000023_000000 "Because you have the order of Charles the third., and you wish to announce the good news to me?"
6070_86745_000024_000000 "No, because I passed the night writing letters,--five and twenty despatches.
6070_86745_000024_000001 I returned home at daybreak, and strove to sleep; but my head ached and I got up to have a ride for an hour.
6070_86745_000024_000002 At the Bois de Boulogne, ennui and hunger attacked me at once,--two enemies who rarely accompany each other, and who are yet leagued against me, a sort of Carlo republican alliance.
6070_86745_000024_000003 I then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning, and here I am.
6070_86745_000024_000004 I am hungry, feed me; I am bored, amuse me."
6070_86745_000025_000002 In the meantime, my dear Lucien, here are cigars-contraband, of course-try them, and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with cabbage leaves."
6070_86745_000026_000000 "Peste, I will do nothing of the kind; the moment they come from government you would find them execrable.
6070_86745_000026_000001 Besides, that does not concern the home but the financial department.
6070_86745_000027_000001 Take a cigar."
6070_86745_000029_000000 "And what would you do, my dear diplomatist," replied Morcerf, with a slight degree of irony in his voice, "if you did nothing?
6128_63240_000000_000000 This is a LibriVox recording.

6128_63240_000005_000000 BY HENRY james
6128_63240_000012_000000 "Olive will come down in about ten minutes; she told me to tell you that.
6128_63240_000012_000002 Neither five nor fifteen, and yet not ten exactly, but either nine or eleven.
6128_63240_000013_000000 These words were spoken with much volubility by a fair, plump, smiling woman who entered a narrow drawing room in which a visitor, kept waiting for a few moments, was already absorbed in a book.
6128_63240_000013_000002 He threw it down at the approach of mrs Luna, laughed, shook hands with her, and said in answer to her last remark, "You imply that you do tell fibs.
6128_63240_000013_000003 Perhaps that is one."
6128_63240_000015_000000 "That has an unflattering sound for me," said the young man.
6128_63240_000015_000001 "I pretend not to prevaricate."
6128_63240_000016_000002 And if she said it, she does really hope it.
6128_63240_000016_000003 She is willing to risk that."
6128_63240_000017_000000 "Just as I am?" the visitor inquired, presenting himself with rather a work a day aspect.
6128_63240_000018_000000 mrs Luna glanced at him from head to foot, and gave a little smiling sigh, as if he had been a long sum in addition.
6128_63240_000018_000001 And, indeed, he was very long, Basil Ransom, and he even looked a little hard and discouraging, like a column of figures, in spite of the friendly face which he bent upon his hostess's deputy, and which, in its thinness, had a deep dry line, a sort of premature wrinkle, on either side of the mouth.
6128_63240_000018_000002 He was tall and lean, and dressed throughout in black; his shirt collar was low and wide, and the triangle of linen, a little crumpled, exhibited by the opening of his waistcoat, was adorned by a pin containing a small red stone.
6128_63240_000018_000003 In spite of this decoration the young man looked poor-as poor as a young man could look who had such a fine head and such magnificent eyes.
6128_63240_000018_000005 His forehead was high and broad, and his thick black hair, perfectly straight and glossy, and without any division, rolled back from it in a leonine manner.
6128_63240_000018_000010 mrs Luna looked up at all this, but saw only a part of it; otherwise she would not have replied in a bantering manner, in answer to his inquiry: "Are you ever different from this?" mrs Luna was familiar-intolerably familiar.
6128_63240_000019_000000 Basil Ransom coloured a little.
6128_63240_000019_000001 Then he said: "Oh yes; when I dine out I usually carry a six shooter and a bowie knife." And he took up his hat vaguely-a soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim. mrs Luna wanted to know what he was doing.
6128_63240_000019_000002 She made him sit down; she assured him that her sister quite expected him, would feel as sorry as she could ever feel for anything-for she was a kind of fatalist, anyhow-if he didn't stay to dinner.
6128_63240_000021_000000 "Well, so it is; they are all witches and wizards, mediums, and spirit rappers, and roaring radicals."
6128_63240_000022_000000 Basil Ransom stared; the yellow light in his brown eyes deepened.
6128_63240_000023_000000 "A radical?
6128_63240_000023_000001 She's a female Jacobin-she's a nihilist.
6128_63240_000023_000003 If you are going to dine with her, you had better know it."
6128_63240_000024_000000 "Oh, murder!" murmured the young man vaguely, sinking back in his chair with his arms folded.
6128_63240_000024_000003 She was attractive and impertinent, especially the latter.
6128_63240_000024_000006 "Well, I suppose I might have known that," he continued, at last.
6128_63240_000025_000000 "You might have known what?"
6128_63240_000026_000000 "Well, that Miss Chancellor would be all that you say.
6128_63240_000026_000001 She was brought up in the city of reform."
6128_63240_000027_000003 That's the way I found her when I returned from Europe."
6128_63240_000028_000000 "Have you been in Europe?" Ransom asked.
6128_63240_000029_000000 "Mercy, yes!
6128_63240_000030_000000 "No, I haven't been anywhere.
6128_63240_000030_000001 Has your sister?"
6128_63240_000031_000001 She hates it; she would like to abolish it.
6128_63240_000032_000001 This last remark he made at a venture, for he had, naturally, not devoted any supposition whatever to mrs Luna.
6128_63240_000032_000002 His dishonesty, however, only exposed him the more.
6128_63240_000033_000000 "If you thought I lived in New York, why in the world didn't you come and see me?" the lady inquired.
6128_63240_000034_000000 "Well, you see, I don't go out much, except to the courts."
6128_63240_000035_000000 "Do you mean the law courts?
6128_63240_000035_000002 Are you very ambitious?
6128_63240_000035_000003 You look as if you were."
6128_63240_000036_000000 "Yes, very," Basil Ransom replied, with a smile, and the curious feminine softness with which Southern gentlemen enunciate that adverb.
6128_63240_000037_000001 "But it isn't the same," she said.
6128_63240_000038_000000 "While you and your little boy don't," the young man remarked.
6128_63240_000039_000000 "Oh no, I never differ from Newton!" And mrs Luna added that now she was back she didn't know what she should do.
6128_63240_000039_000003 They had invented it while she was away.
6128_63240_000040_000000 Basil Ransom had got up just as mrs Luna made this last declaration; for a young lady had glided into the room, who stopped short as it fell upon her ears.
6128_63240_000040_000001 She stood there looking, consciously and rather seriously, at mr Ransom; a smile of exceeding faintness played about her lips-it was just perceptible enough to light up the native gravity of her face.
6128_63240_000040_000002 It might have been likened to a thin ray of moonlight resting upon the wall of a prison.
6128_63240_000042_000002 mrs Luna explained to her sister that her freedom of speech was caused by his being a relation-though, indeed, he didn't seem to know much about them.
6128_63240_000042_000003 She didn't believe he had ever heard of her, mrs Luna, though he pretended, with his Southern chivalry, that he had.
6128_63240_000043_000001 Try to reform him; a person from Mississippi is sure to be all wrong.
6128_63240_000043_000003 Good bye, mr Ransom," mrs Luna continued, gathering up the feathery white shawl which added to the volume of her fairness.
6128_63240_000043_000006 You only stay to morrow?
6128_63240_000043_000007 Why, what's the use of that?
6128_63240_000043_000008 Well, mind you come and see me in New York; I shall be sure to be part of the winter there.
6128_63240_000043_000010 Don't come out; my sister has the first claim.
6128_63240_000043_000012 "I am glad I haven't opinions that prevent my dressing in the evening!" she declared from the doorway.
6128_63241_000002_000000 Whether much or little consideration had been directed to the result, Miss Chancellor certainly would not have incurred this reproach.
6128_63241_000002_000001 She was habited in a plain dark dress, without any ornaments, and her smooth, colourless hair was confined as carefully as that of her sister was encouraged to stray.
6128_63241_000002_000003 The young man was therefore free to look at her; a contemplation which showed him that she was agitated and trying to conceal it.
6128_63241_000002_000004 He wondered why she was agitated, not foreseeing that he was destined to discover, later, that her nature was like a skiff in a stormy sea.
6128_63241_000002_000006 Miss Olive Chancellor, it may be confided to the reader, to whom in the course of our history I shall be under the necessity of imparting much occult information, was subject to fits of tragic shyness, during which she was unable to meet even her own eyes in the mirror.
6128_63241_000002_000007 One of these fits had suddenly seized her now, without any obvious cause, though, indeed, mrs Luna had made it worse by becoming instantly so personal.
6128_63241_000002_000008 There was nothing in the world so personal as mrs Luna; her sister could have hated her for it if she had not forbidden herself this emotion as directed to individuals.
6128_63241_000002_000010 He was on his guard against generalisations which might be hasty; but he had arrived at two or three that were of value to a gentleman lately admitted to the New York bar and looking out for clients.
6128_63241_000002_000011 One of them was to the effect that the simplest division it is possible to make of the human race is into the people who take things hard and the people who take them easy.
6128_63241_000002_000012 He perceived very quickly that Miss Chancellor belonged to the former class.
6128_63241_000002_000013 This was written so intensely in her delicate face that he felt an unformulated pity for her before they had exchanged twenty words.
6128_63241_000002_000015 But this pale girl, with her light green eyes, her pointed features and nervous manner, was visibly morbid; it was as plain as day that she was morbid.
6128_63241_000002_000017 It proved nothing of any importance, with regard to Miss Chancellor, to say that she was morbid; any sufficient account of her would lie very much to the rear of that.
6128_63241_000002_000019 The women he had hitherto known had been mainly of his own soft clime, and it was not often they exhibited the tendency he detected (and cursorily deplored) in mrs Luna's sister.
6128_63241_000002_000020 That was the way he liked them-not to think too much, not to feel any responsibility for the government of the world, such as he was sure Miss Chancellor felt.
6128_63241_000002_000021 If they would only be private and passive, and have no feeling but for that, and leave publicity to the sex of tougher hide!
6128_63241_000002_000022 Ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy; it must be repeated that he was very provincial.
6128_63241_000003_000001 He was sorry for her, but he saw in a flash that no one could help her: that was what made her tragic.
6128_63241_000003_000002 He had not, seeking his fortune, come away from the blighted South, which weighed upon his heart, to look out for tragedies; at least he didn't want them outside of his office in Pine Street.
6128_63241_000003_000004 She was reassured at finding that her visitor was peculiar; the way he spoke told her that it was no wonder he had fought on the Southern side.
6128_63241_000003_000005 She had never yet encountered a personage so exotic, and she always felt more at her ease in the presence of anything strange.
6128_63241_000003_000006 It was the usual things of life that filled her with silent rage; which was natural enough, inasmuch as, to her vision, almost everything that was usual was iniquitous.
6128_63241_000003_000007 She had no difficulty in asking him now whether he would not stay to dinner-she hoped Adeline had given him her message.
6128_63241_000004_000000 It was the same sort of impulse that had moved her to write to Basil Ransom, in the spring, after hearing accidentally that he had come to the North and intended, in New York, to practise his profession.
6128_63241_000004_000006 His family was ruined; they had lost their slaves, their property, their friends and relations, their home; had tasted of all the cruelty of defeat.
6128_63241_000004_000008 The State of Mississippi seemed to him the state of despair; so he surrendered the remnants of his patrimony to his mother and sisters, and, at nearly thirty years of age, alighted for the first time in New York, in the costume of his province, with fifty dollars in his pocket and a gnawing hunger in his heart.
6128_63241_000005_000002 It was "in the female line," as Basil Ransom had written, in answering her letter with a good deal of form and flourish; he spoke as if they had been royal houses.
6128_63241_000005_000004 By the time Basil came to the North-making advances, as it were-mrs
6128_63241_000005_000005 Chancellor had passed away; so it was for Olive, left alone in the little house in Charles Street (Adeline being in Europe), to decide.
6128_63241_000006_000000 She knew what her mother would have done, and that helped her decision; for her mother always chose the positive course.
6128_63241_000006_000003 She had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that whenever she saw a risk she was to take it; and she had frequent humiliations at finding herself safe after all.
6128_63241_000006_000004 She was perfectly safe after writing to Basil Ransom; and, indeed, it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except thank her (he was only exceptionally superlative) for her letter, and assure her that he would come and see her the first time his business (he was beginning to get a little) should take him to Boston.
6128_63241_000006_000006 She saw (when once she had looked at him) that he would not put those worldly interpretations on things which, with her, it was both an impulse and a principle to defy.
6128_63241_000006_000007 He was too simple-too Mississippian-for that; she was almost disappointed.
6128_63241_000006_000010 Nothing could be more displeasing than this indifference when people didn't agree with you.
6128_63244_000000_000000 Olive Chancellor received this appeal with peculiar feelings.
6128_63244_000000_000005 She knew her place in the Boston hierarchy, and it was not what mrs Farrinder supposed; so that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been a representative of the aristocracy.
6128_63244_000000_000018 They cared far more about Charlie than about the ballot.
6128_63244_000001_000004 Our movement is for all-it appeals to the most delicate ladies.
6128_63244_000001_000005 Raise the standard among them, and bring me a thousand names.
6128_63244_000001_000006 I know several that I should like to have.
6128_63244_000002_000000 "I can't talk to those people, I can't!" said Olive Chancellor, with a face which seemed to plead for a remission of responsibility.
6128_63244_000002_000003 I want to be near to them-to help them.
6128_63244_000002_000004 I want to do something-oh, I should like so to speak!"
6128_63244_000005_000001 "Have you got money?"
6128_63244_000007_000003 The unhappiness of women!
6128_63244_000007_000012 She had been consumed by the passion of sympathy; it had crumpled her into as many creases as an old glazed, distended glove.
6128_63244_000007_000013 She had been laughed at, but she never knew it; she was treated as a bore, but she never cared.
61_70970_000007_000001 Go to her."
6432_63722_000000_000000 "That's all right, Shag.
6432_63722_000000_000001 You do as I tell you.
6432_63722_000000_000003 But for a quiet place to think, give me a fishing excursion every time!
6432_63722_000000_000004 And I've got to do some tall thinking now.
6432_63722_000000_000005 Get ready, Shag!"
6432_63722_000003_000000 Carroll and Thong were there, and if they did not exactly welcome the colonel as a kindred spirit they at least accorded him the respect due a fellow craftsman in the peculiar line where talent may be found most unexpectedly.
6432_63722_000003_000002 For they recognized that the colonel would be against them and the prosecutor's detectives when it came to the trial of james Darcy.
6432_63722_000005_000000 "Some Dago had his head busted in," remarked Thong.
6432_63722_000005_000001 "It isn't our case, so we don't know much about it."
6432_63722_000006_000001 Who has it?"
6432_63722_000007_000000 "Pinkus and Donovan; haven't they, Carroll?"
6432_63722_000008_000000 "Yep." Carroll was too much engaged in watching the blue smoke curl lazily upward from his cigar just then to say more.
6432_63722_000010_000000 "If they're here, yes."
6432_63722_000011_000001 "Are you going to work on that case, Colonel?"
6432_63722_000012_000000 "Oh, no I was just interested, as Singa Phut was one concerned in mrs Darcy's murder."
6432_63722_000014_000000 "Perhaps not," admitted Colonel Ashley.
6432_63722_000014_000001 "But there are some peculiar coincidences and, if you don't mind, I'd like to see what I can find out about them."
6432_63722_000015_000000 "Go as far as you like, Colonel," returned Thong, needlessly generous. "We've got our man, and that's all we want.
6432_63722_000015_000002 "Here's some one to see you," and the presentation was quickly and informally made.
6432_63722_000015_000003 The two men had seen each other before, but had not spoken.
6432_63722_000016_000000 "Glad to know you, Colonel Ashley," said Donovan.
6432_63722_000016_000001 "I've read a lot about you.
6432_63722_000016_000002 You're on the Darcy case, they tell me."
6432_63722_000017_000000 "In a way, yes.
6432_63722_000017_000001 I'm working in the interests of the young man.
6432_63722_000017_000002 But I hear you have another murder."
6432_63722_000018_000000 "Yes, but it's so plain there's no interest in it for you.
6432_63722_000018_000001 All we want to do-Pinkus and me-is to lay our hands on the Dago that done it and got away.
6432_63722_000018_000002 We'll get him, too, before many days.
6432_63722_000019_000000 "How did it happen?
6432_63722_000019_000001 And is there any truth in the newspaper story about the same watch that was found in mrs Darcy's hand being found in the hand of the dead man?"
6432_63722_000020_000000 "Yes, that part's true enough, but that's all there is to it.
6432_63722_000020_000001 It's just one of them coincidences like.
6432_63722_000020_000002 Singa Phut got back his watch after the prosecutor decided he didn't need it for evidence.
6432_63722_000020_000003 There wasn't nothing that Singa had to do with the Darcy case anyhow, and he seemed awful anxious to get back that watch.
6432_63722_000021_000000 "But did he really kill his partner?"
6432_63722_000022_000000 "Surest thing you know.
6432_63722_000022_000001 Busted his head in with a heavy candlestick-one of a pair.
6432_63722_000024_000000 "Gad!" exclaimed the colonel.
6432_63722_000024_000001 "The very pair I was going to buy!"
6432_63722_000025_000000 "What!
6432_63722_000025_000001 You buy?" cried Donovan.
6432_63722_000025_000002 "Look here, Colonel! do you know anything about this?" and the detective's professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness.
6432_63722_000026_000000 "Not the least in the world-not as much as you do," was the cool answer.
6432_63722_000026_000002 Now, I'm afraid I won't.
6432_63722_000026_000003 But how did it happen?"
6432_63722_000027_000000 "Oh, well, there isn't much of a story to it," and Donovan's voice showed his disappointment.
6432_63722_000027_000002 No one knows much about Ali, for he came here just recently.
6432_63722_000028_000000 "Neighbors often heard 'em scrappin' a lot, and this afternoon they went at it again hot and heavy.
6432_63722_000028_000001 Then things quieted down, and nobody heard anything more.
6432_63722_000028_000003 He found the place without a light in it, stumbled over something on the floor, and there was Ali's body, with the head busted in and this heavy candlestick near it.
6432_63722_000029_000000 "He raised the howl right off, and Pinkus and I got there as soon as we could.
6432_63722_000029_000002 But we'll get him!"
6432_63722_000030_000000 "Then you think he did it?"
6432_63722_000031_000000 "Sure he did!
6432_63722_000031_000001 Who else?"
6432_63722_000032_000000 "And the watch was in Ali's hand?"
6432_63722_000033_000000 "Sure!
6432_63722_000033_000001 Held so tight we could hardly get it out.
6432_63722_000033_000002 In fact it was so tight that he's cut his palm grabbin' hold of it.
6432_63722_000033_000003 Maybe the fight was about who owned the watch, for the Dagos talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbors could tell what they were sayin'."
6432_63722_000034_000000 "I see.
6432_63722_000034_000001 And the watch?
6432_63722_000034_000002 Have you it?"
6432_63722_000035_000000 "Yes, it's here.
6432_63722_000035_000002 Hear it tick?" and Donovan held open the door of his closet.
6432_63722_000036_000000 "That's the watch," announced the headquarters detective, reaching in for it.
6432_63722_000037_000000 Somewhat to the surprise of Donovan the military detective accepted the timepiece on his open palm, and so gingerly that it caused Donovan to remark:
6432_63722_000038_000000 "You're not as squeamish as all that, are you?
6432_63722_000039_000000 "Oh, not at all," was the quick answer.
6432_63722_000039_000001 "But, as a matter of fact these East Indians are often carriers of bubonic plague, you know, and it's very contagious.
6432_63722_000041_000000 "Yes.
6432_63722_000041_000002 And I've read enough about germs to know the danger.
6432_63722_000041_000003 I'd advise you to be careful!"
6432_63722_000042_000000 "Ha!" laughed Donovan shortly.
6432_63722_000042_000001 "I should worry about that!
6432_63722_000043_000000 Colonel Ashley said nothing.
6432_63722_000044_000000 "Quite a curiosity," said the colonel at length.
6432_63722_000044_000001 "If you don't mind, I should like to examine this a bit."
6432_63722_000045_000000 "You can't take it away," said Donovan.
6432_63722_000045_000001 "I may need it as evidence when we get mr Phut, or whatever the Dago's name is."
6432_63722_000046_000000 "Oh, no, I wouldn't think of taking it away.
6432_63722_000046_000002 Quite an interesting study-watches-Donovan.
6432_63722_000046_000003 Ever take it up?" and as the colonel questioned he was looking at the Indian timepiece under a magnifying glass he took from his pocket.
6432_63722_000047_000000 "Who?
6432_63722_000047_000001 Me study watches?
6432_63722_000047_000002 I should say not!
6432_63722_000048_000000 "Yes," went on the colonel musingly.
6432_63722_000048_000001 "This is an old timer.
6432_63722_000048_000003 That was away back in the fifteenth century."
6432_63722_000050_000001 "But, all joking aside, this is quite a wonderful piece of work.
6432_63722_000050_000002 I shouldn't be surprised but what it dated back to the time of Queen Elizabeth, though it has been repaired and remodeled since then to make it more up to date.
6432_63722_000050_000003 Probably new works put in.
6432_63722_000050_000004 Queen Elizabeth was very fond of watches and clocks, and her friends, knowing that, used to present her with beautiful specimens. Some of the watches of her day were made in the form of crosses, purses, little books, and even skulls."
6432_63722_000052_000000 "That's right," agreed the colonel, as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch.
6432_63722_000052_000001 And a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the timepiece, but poked it about, and touched it here and there, with the end of a leadpencil.
6432_63722_000053_000000 "Very interesting," observed the colonel, as he passed the watch back to Donovan, still using only the flat, open palm of his hand on which to rest it.
6432_63722_000053_000001 "Very interesting.
6432_63722_000053_000002 And, Donovan, take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch."
6432_63722_000054_000000 "Too free with it?" asked the surprised detective.
6432_63722_000055_000000 "Yes.
6432_63722_000055_000001 Don't scratch yourself on it, whatever you do."
6432_63722_000056_000000 "Why not?
6432_63722_000057_000000 "Simply because this watch-"
6432_63722_000059_000000 "Donovan!"
6432_63722_000060_000000 "Hello," answered the sleuth.
6432_63722_000061_000000 "Some one out here to see you."
6432_63722_000062_000000 "All right-be there in a second.
6432_63722_000062_000002 "Be back in a minute."
6432_63722_000064_000000 "What's up?" asked Carroll.
6432_63722_000065_000000 "Singa Phut," was the panting answer.
6432_63722_000065_000001 "Friend of mine just tipped me off where I can get him!
6432_63722_000065_000002 See you later!" and, making sure that his blackjack and revolver were in his pockets, Donovan hurried out, followed by the colonel, whose hand had loosely closed over the ticking watch which, unseen, went out with him.
6432_63722_000069_000000 "I want to talk over Darcy's case with you," the colonel had said.
6432_63722_000070_000000 And the two had talked, had thought, had talked again, and now were silent for a time.
6432_63722_000071_000000 "What are the chances of getting him off legally if we go at it from a negative standpoint?" asked the colonel.
6432_63722_000072_000000 "Rather a hypothetical question, Colonel, but I should say it might be a fifty fifty proposition.
6432_63722_000073_000000 "I don't want it, either.
6432_63722_000073_000001 But I want to know just where we stand.
6432_63722_000073_000002 Now I know.
6432_63722_000073_000003 We've got to prove james Darcy innocent by establishing the fact that some one else killed his cousin."
6432_63722_000074_000000 "Exactly.
6432_63722_000074_000001 And can it be done?"
6432_63722_000075_000000 "It can, and I'm going to do it.
6432_63722_000075_000001 But I need to do a little more smoking out first.
6432_63722_000075_000002 Now I want to think.
6432_63722_000075_000003 If you'll excuse me I'll pretend I'm fishing, and I may catch something.
6432_63722_000075_000004 In fact, I have a feeling that I'll land my fish.
6432_63722_000075_000006 Ah, there's nothing like the philosophy of my friend Izaak Walton.
6432_63722_000075_000007 I'd recommend him to you instead of Blackstone."
6432_63722_000076_000000 "Thanks!" laughed Kenneth.
6432_63722_000076_000002 And you are right.
6432_63722_000076_000003 I have a little problem on my hands."
6432_63722_000077_000000 "What is it?
6432_63722_000077_000001 Perhaps I can help you.
6432_63722_000077_000002 The old adage of two heads, you know-"
6432_63722_000078_000000 "Yes.
6432_63722_000078_000001 It still holds good.
6432_63722_000078_000002 Well, the question I am trying to solve is why did she say: 'No alimony!'"
6432_63722_000079_000000 "'No alimony'?" repeated the colonel, puzzled.
6432_63722_000080_000000 "Yes.
6432_63722_000080_000001 Just that.
6432_63722_000080_000002 As you may have guessed, it's a divorce case I have just finished, and so quietly that it hasn't become public property yet.
6432_63722_000080_000003 When it does it will create a sensation."
6432_63722_000081_000001 I suppose the lady-there is a lady in it, of course?" questioned the colonel.
6432_63722_000082_000000 "Of course-as is usual in a divorce case.
6432_63722_000082_000001 And there's no reason you shouldn't know.
6432_63722_000082_000002 It's mrs Larch, wife of Langford Larch, the wealthy hotel owner.
6432_63722_000082_000003 She has just been granted, on my application before the vice chancellor, a separation from her husband, but she refused to accept alimony, and for the life of me, with all Larch's wealth, I can't see why.
6432_63723_000001_000000 THE ODD COIN
6432_63723_000002_000000 Colonel Ashley fished for a time in silence, broken only by the gentle snores of Shag, farther back in the field, and by the murmur of the water.
6432_63723_000002_000001 The old colored man, wrapped in a warm coat, for it was not summer yet, seemed to be enjoying his siesta when, with a suddenness that was startling in that solitude, the military detective uttered a cry of:
6432_63723_000003_000000 "I've got it!"
6432_63723_000004_000000 "What?" called Kenneth.
6432_63723_000004_000001 "The solution to my problem?"
6432_63723_000005_000000 "No!
6432_63723_000005_000001 My fish!" chuckled the colonel, as he skilfully played the luckless trout, now struggling to get loose from the hook.
6432_63723_000006_000000 And when the fish was landed, panting on the grass, and Shag had been roused from his slumber to slip the now limp fish into the creel, Colonel Ashley gave a sigh of relief and remarked:
6432_63723_000007_000000 "I think I see it now."
6432_63723_000008_000000 "The reason she asked no alimony?" inquired Kenneth.
6432_63723_000009_000000 "no
6432_63723_000009_000001 I wasn't thinking of that.
6432_63723_000009_000002 But I have been gathering up some loose ends, and I think I know where to tie them together.
6432_63723_000009_000003 However, don't think I'm not interested in your case.
6432_63723_000009_000004 I've fished enough for to day.
6432_63723_000009_000005 Not that, ordinarily, I'm satisfied with one, but I'm not working the rod now.
6432_63723_000009_000006 I am, as Shag calls it, 'detectin',' and I just came out here to clarify my thoughts.
6432_63723_000009_000007 Having done that, I'm at your service, if I can help."
6432_63723_000010_000000 "Well, I don't know that you can.
6432_63723_000010_000001 As I said, the facts of the separation of the Larchs will soon be heralded all over the city, for the final papers were filed to day, and the reporters will be sure to see them.
6432_63723_000010_000003 It's a plain and sordid story enough, with the exception of her refusal of alimony, and that I can't understand.
6432_63723_000011_000000 "Certainly, my dear Kenneth."
6432_63723_000012_000000 "It has no connection with the Darcy murder, and so I didn't mention it to you before."
6432_63723_000013_000000 "Go on."
6432_63723_000014_000000 "It isn't generally known," went on the lawyer, "that the hotel keeper's wife has left him.
6432_63723_000016_000000 "That's what he did.
6432_63723_000016_000001 He seems to have been decent for a while after their marriage-which marriage was a mistake from the first-I can see that now.
6432_63723_000016_000002 I used to know Cynthia when she was a girl-she was the daughter of Lodan Ratchford, and her mother had peculiar and, to my mind, wrong ideas of social position and money.
6432_63723_000016_000003 Well, poor Cynthia is paying the penalty now.
6432_63723_000016_000004 She was really forced into this marriage which, to say the least, must have been distasteful to her.
6432_63723_000016_000005 But I don't suppose more than two or three know that."
6432_63723_000017_000000 The colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him. Aaron Grafton's statement was being unexpectedly confirmed.
6432_63723_000017_000001 He remembered that Cynthia and Grafton had once been in love with each other.
6432_63723_000018_000000 "Well, when Cynthia came to me, in my capacity as lawyer as well as old friend, I could hardly believe what she told me about her husband," went on Kenneth.
6432_63723_000018_000001 "She said he had struck her more than once, and she could stand it no longer.
6432_63723_000019_000001 On those grounds I went before the vice chancellor, prepared to prove my case by competent witnesses.
6432_63723_000019_000002 But they were not needed."
6432_63723_000020_000000 "Why not?"
6432_63723_000021_000000 "Because Larch made no defense.
6432_63723_000021_000001 He let the case go by default, for which I was glad, as it saved Cynthia from telling her story in open court.
6432_63723_000021_000002 Larch, by refusing to appear, practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation.
6432_63723_000023_000002 She had some means of her own, she declared, and would work rather than accept a cent from him.
6432_63723_000025_000000 "Did he pay it?"
6432_63723_000026_000000 "No; but he will, or I'll sue him and get judgment.
6432_63723_000026_000001 Oh, he'll pay all right.
6432_63723_000026_000002 He'll be so tickled to get out of paying his wife a monthly sum that he'll settle with me.
6432_63723_000026_000004 For I really think he loved Cynthia once.
6432_63723_000026_000006 Well, it's a queer world anyhow!"
6432_63723_000027_000000 "Isn't it?" agreed the colonel.
6432_63723_000027_000001 "And it takes all sorts of persons to make it up.
6432_63723_000028_000000 "Not a great deal.
6432_63723_000028_000001 Still I would like to know.
6432_63723_000028_000002 There will be a sensation when this comes out."
6432_63723_000030_000000 The murder of mrs Darcy had, some time ago, been shifted off the front page, though it would get back there when the young jeweler was tried. As for the killing of Shere Ali, that occasioned only passing interest, the murdered man not being well known.
6432_63723_000031_000000 But the separation of mr and mrs Larch was different.
6432_63723_000031_000001 The finely appointed hotel kept by Larch, called the "Homestead," from the name of an old inn of Colonial days which it replaced, was known for miles around.
6432_63723_000031_000002 It had a double reputation, so to speak.
6432_63723_000031_000004 Grave, and even reverend, conventions assembled in its ballroom, and politicians of the upper, if not better, class were frequently seen in its dining room or cafe.
6432_63723_000031_000005 Being convenient to the courthouse, nearly all the judges and lawyers took lunch there.
6432_63723_000032_000000 Larch himself was a peculiar character.
6432_63723_000032_000001 In a smaller place he would have been called a saloon keeper.
6432_63723_000032_000002 Going a little higher up the scale in population he might have been designated as a hotel proprietor.
6432_63723_000032_000003 But in Colchester, which was rather unique among cities, he was looked up to as one of the substantial citizens of the place, for he owned the Homestead, where Washington, when it was a wayside inn, had stopped one night-at least such was the rumor-and families socially prominent, some of whose members had very strong views on prohibition, did not hesitate to attend balls given at the hotel.
6432_63723_000034_000000 "Why did she take him?"
6432_63723_000035_000000 To this was the answer-whispered:
6432_63723_000036_000000 "Money!"
6432_63723_000037_000000 And, in a way, it was true.
6432_63723_000037_000002 She also saw an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges.
6432_63723_000038_000001 After the marriage, which was a brilliant and gay one, if not happy, the Larch hotel-it could hardly be called a home-became the scene of many festive occasions.
6432_63723_000039_000000 Langford Larch could not himself be called a drinking man. Occasionally, as almost perforce he had to, he drank a little wine. But he was never noticeably drunk.
6432_63723_000039_000001 Nor was that side of his business ever accentuated.
6432_63723_000040_000000 Gradually there had come about little whispers that Cynthia Larch had made a mistake in her marriage.
6432_63723_000040_000001 There was little that was tangible-mere gossip-a hint that she would have been happier with some one else, though he had not so much money as had Larch.
6432_63723_000041_000000 The rumors floated about a bit, seemed to sink, and then started off at full steam just before the news of the separation became public.
6432_63723_000042_000000 But, for a time, the entertainments were kept up, and Cynthia, lovelier than ever, presided at her husband's table, graced it with her presence, and laughed and smiled at the men and women who came to partake of their lavish hospitality.
6432_63723_000044_000001 And that behind the laughter in her eyes was the shadow of a skeleton at the feast.
6432_63723_000044_000003 mrs Larch, resuming, her maiden name, it was announced, had gone to a quiet place to rest.
6432_63723_000045_000002 It was all due to a misunderstanding, he said.
6432_63723_000046_000001 For the papers of her testimony had been sealed, and it was only by a sharp trick on the part of Daley that he got access to them.
6432_63723_000046_000002 Incidentally the vice chancelor was furious when it became known that the documents had been inspected by a reporter, but then it was too late.
6432_63723_000049_000002 And it was whispered about:
6432_63723_000050_000000 "Larch is lushing!"
6432_63723_000051_000000 Meanwhile Colonel Ashley was a very busy man, and to no one did he tell very much about his activities.
6432_63723_000051_000001 He saw Darcy frequently at the jail, and to that young man's pleadings that something be done, always returned the answer:
6432_63723_000052_000000 "Don't worry!
6432_63723_000052_000001 It will come out all right!"
6432_63723_000053_000000 "But Amy-and the disgrace?"
6432_63723_000054_000000 "She doesn't consider herself disgraced, and you shouldn't.
6432_63723_000054_000001 The best of police headquarters or prosecutor's detectives make mistakes.
6432_63723_000054_000002 I'm going to rectify them.
6432_63723_000054_000003 But it will take time."
6432_63723_000055_000000 "Do you know who killed my cousin?"
6432_63723_000056_000000 "I think I do."
6432_63723_000057_000000 "Then for the love of-"
6432_63723_000058_000000 "I can't tell you yet, Darcy.
6432_63723_000058_000001 All in good time.
6432_63723_000059_000000 "You've got a friend in her of whom you may be proud.
6432_63723_000059_000001 And her father, too-he's with you from the drop of the flag, he told me.
6432_63723_000059_000002 Quite a racing man he is, a gentleman and a fine judge not only of whisky, which is good in its place, but of horses and men, too.
6432_63723_000059_000003 Darcy, you've got good friends!"
6432_63723_000061_000000 "Thanks.
6432_63723_000061_000002 All in good time.
6432_63723_000061_000003 I'm working several ends, and they all must be fitted together, like the old jigsaw puzzle, before I can act.
6432_63723_000061_000004 Besides, anything I could say now wouldn't set you free.
6432_63723_000061_000005 You can't get out before a trial or before I can produce some one on whom I can actually fasten the murder.
6432_63723_000061_000006 And I can't do that yet.
6432_63723_000061_000007 You aren't the only suspect, though.
6432_63723_000061_000008 There's Harry King, still locked up-"
6432_63723_000063_000000 "He isn't?" cried the old detective, and there was surprise in his voice.
6432_63723_000064_000000 "no
6432_63723_000064_000001 He was bailed out to day.
6432_63723_000064_000002 I thought you knew it."
6432_63723_000065_000000 "I didn't.
6432_63723_000065_000001 I'm glad you told me, though.
6432_63723_000065_000002 So King got bail!
6432_63723_000065_000003 Who put it up?
6432_63723_000066_000000 "Larch!"
6432_63723_000067_000000 "The hotel keeper?"
6432_63723_000068_000000 "So I understand.
6432_63723_000068_000001 They took Harry away a while ago.
6432_63723_000068_000002 I wish I had been in his shoes."
6432_63723_000069_000000 "I'm glad you're not.
6432_63723_000069_000001 I don't imagine, for a moment, that fool King had a hand in this affair.
6432_63723_000069_000003 But his are pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same.
6432_63723_000069_000004 Now cheer up!
6432_63723_000069_000006 So cheer up, and I'll do the best I can for you.
6432_63723_000070_000000 "Only that I-" Darcy hesitated and grew red.
6432_63723_000071_000000 "I guess I understand," said the colonel with a laugh.
6432_63723_000071_000001 "I'll tell her!"
6432_63723_000072_000001 A number of "men about town," as they liked to be called, were in, and Colonel Ashley was sipping his julep when there entered mr Kettridge, the relative of mrs Darcy, whose jewelry shop he was managing pending a settlement of her estate.
6432_63723_000073_000000 "Good evening, Colonel," he called genially.
6432_63723_000073_000001 "Will you join me in a Welsh rabbit?"
6432_63723_000074_000000 "Thank you, no I'm afraid my digestion isn't quite up to that, as I've had to cut out my fishing of late.
6432_63723_000075_000001 They had become friends since the colonel's first visit to the store, and the friendship had grown as they found they had congenial tastes.
6432_63723_000076_000000 The evening passed pleasantly for them.
6432_63723_000076_000001 They talked of much, including the murder, and the colonel was more than pleased to find that the jeweler had no very strong suspicion against young Darcy.
6432_63723_000077_000000 "I've known him from a boy," said mr Kettridge, "and, though he has his faults, a crime such as this would be almost impossible to him, no matter what motive, such as the dispute over money or his sweetheart. He may be guilty, but I doubt it."
6432_63723_000078_000000 "My idea, exactly," returned the colonel.
6432_63723_000078_000001 "Now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder.
6432_63723_000078_000002 The stopped clocks, for instance.
6432_63723_000078_000003 Have you any theory-"
6432_63723_000079_000000 Came, at that instant, fairly bursting into the quiet grill room, some "jolly good fellows," to take them at their own valuation.
6432_63723_000079_000001 There were three of them, the center figure being that of Harry King, and he was very much intoxicated.
6432_63723_000080_000000 "Hello, Harry!
6432_63723_000081_000000 King regarded his questioner gravely, as though deeply pondering over the matter.
6432_63723_000081_000001 It was often characteristic of him that, though he became very much intoxicated, yet, at times, under such conditions, Harry King's language approached the cultured, rather than degenerated into the common talk of the ordinary drunk.
6432_63723_000081_000002 That is not always, but sometimes.
6432_63723_000081_000003 It happened to be so now.
6432_63723_000082_000000 "I beg your pardon?" he said, in the cultured tones he knew so well how to use, yet of which he made so little use of late.
6432_63723_000083_000000 "I said, where have you been?" remarked the other.
6432_63723_000083_000001 "We've missed you."
6432_63723_000084_000000 "I have been spending a week end in the country," King remarked, with biting sarcasm.
6432_63723_000085_000000 There was a laugh at this, for scarcely one in the gilded grill but knew where King had been, and whither he was going.
6432_63723_000088_000000 "Why Polonius?" some one asked.
6432_63723_000089_000000 "Because, dear friend," replied King softly, "he somewhat resembles a certain person here, who talks too much, but who is not so wise as he thinks.
672_122797_000000_000000 THE FIR TREE
672_122797_000002_000002 What a nice little fir!" But this was what the Tree could not bear to hear.
672_122797_000011_000002 What is it like?"
672_122797_000020_000003 Were Christmas but come!
672_122797_000024_000001 "How it will shine this evening!"
672_122797_000028_000000 "Help!
672_122797_000030_000000 "What are they about?" thought the Tree.
672_122797_000053_000000 "No," said the Tree.
672_122797_000057_000002 All passed so quickly, there was so much going on around him, the Tree quite forgot to look to himself.
6829_68769_000001_000000 THE FORGED CHECK
6829_68769_000002_000000 Kenneth and Beth refrained from telling the other girls or Uncle john of old Will Rogers's visit, but they got mr Watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check.
6829_68769_000004_000000 "But it was a generous act, too," said Beth.
6829_68769_000005_000000 "I can't see it in that light," said the old lawyer.
6829_68769_000005_000001 "It was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved.
6829_68769_000005_000003 The Squierses are a selfish, hard fisted lot, and the old lady, especially, is a well known virago. But they could not have proven a case against Lucy, if she was innocent, and all their threats of arresting her were probably mere bluff.
6829_68769_000005_000004 So this boy was doubly foolish in ruining himself to get sixty dollars to pay an unjust demand."
6829_68769_000006_000000 "He was soft hearted and impetuous," said Beth; "and, being in love, he didn't stop to count the cost."
6829_68769_000007_000001 "Indeed there is never an excuse for crime.
6829_68769_000007_000002 The young man is guilty, and he must suffer the penalty."
6829_68769_000008_000000 "Is there no way to save him?" asked Kenneth.
6829_68769_000009_000000 "If the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check, then the young man would be allowed his freedom. But under the circumstances I doubt if such an arrangement could be made."
6829_68769_000010_000000 "We're going to try it, anyhow," was the prompt decision.
6829_68769_000011_000000 So as soon as breakfast was over the next morning Beth and Kenneth took one of the automobiles, the boy consenting unwillingly to this sort of locomotion because it would save much time.
6829_68769_000011_000001 Fairview was twelve miles away, but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county jail.
6829_68769_000012_000000 They were received in the little office by a man named Markham, who was the jailer.
6829_68769_000012_000001 He was a round faced, respectable appearing fellow, but his mood was distinctly unsociable.
6829_68769_000013_000001 Well! what for?" he demanded.
6829_68769_000014_000000 "We wish to talk with him," answered Kenneth.
6829_68769_000015_000000 "Talk! what's the good?
6829_68769_000015_000001 You're no friend of Tom Gates.
6829_68769_000016_000000 "I am Kenneth Forbes, of Elmhurst.
6829_68769_000016_000001 I'm running for Representative on the Republican ticket," said Kenneth, quietly.
6829_68769_000017_000001 that's different," observed Markham, altering his demeanor. "You mustn't mind my being gruff and grumpy, mr Forbes.
6829_68769_000017_000002 I've just stopped smoking a few days ago, and it's got on my nerves something awful!"
6829_68769_000019_000000 "Sure ly!
6829_68769_000019_000001 I'll take you to his cell, myself.
6829_68769_000019_000003 Come this way, please."
6829_68769_000022_000000 He unlocked the door, and called:
6829_68769_000023_000000 "Here's visitors, Tom."
6829_68769_000024_000000 "Thank you, mr Markham," replied a quiet voice, as a young man came forward from the dim interior of the cell.
6829_68769_000024_000001 "How are you feeling, today?"
6829_68769_000026_000000 "Well, stick it out, old man; don't give in."
6829_68769_000027_000000 "I won't, Tom.
6829_68769_000028_000000 "Miss DeGraf," said Kenneth, noticing the boy's face critically, as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it.
6829_68769_000028_000001 "Will you leave us alone, please, mr Markham?"
6829_68769_000029_000000 "Sure ly, mr Forbes.
6829_68769_000029_000002 I'll come and get you then.
6829_68769_000029_000003 Sorry we haven't any reception room in the jail.
6829_68769_000030_000000 Then he deliberately locked Kenneth and Beth in with the forger, and retreated along the passage.
6829_68769_000032_000000 "We've come to inquire about your case, Gates," said Kenneth.
6829_68769_000033_000000 "Yes, sir, I plead guilty, although I've been told I ought not to confess.
6829_68769_000034_000000 "Why did you do it?" asked Beth.
6829_68769_000035_000000 He was silent and turned his face away.
6829_68769_000036_000000 A fresh, wholesome looking boy, was Tom Gates, with steady gray eyes, an intelligent forehead, but a sensitive, rather weak mouth.
6829_68769_000036_000001 He was of sturdy, athletic build and dressed neatly in a suit that was of coarse material but well brushed and cared for.
6829_68769_000037_000001 Kenneth decided that he was ill at ease and in a state of dogged self repression.
6829_68769_000038_000000 "We have heard something of your story," said Kenneth, "and are interested in it.
6829_68769_000041_000000 "Lucy is very proud.
6829_68769_000043_000000 "Yes; she'll worry about me, I know.
6829_68769_000044_000000 "Would you like that?" asked Beth.
6829_68769_000045_000000 "No, indeed," he replied, frankly.
6829_68769_000045_000001 "But it will be best that way.
6829_68769_000045_000002 I had to stand by Lucy-she's so sweet and gentle, and so sensitive.
6829_68769_000045_000003 I don't say I did right.
6829_68769_000045_000004 I only say I'd do the same thing again."
6829_68769_000046_000000 "Couldn't her parents have helped her?" inquired Kenneth.
6829_68769_000047_000000 "no Old Will is a fine fellow, but poor and helpless since mrs Rogers had her accident."
6829_68769_000048_000000 "Oh, did she have an accident?" asked Beth.
6829_68769_000049_000000 "Yes.
6829_68769_000049_000002 She's blind."
6829_68769_000050_000000 "Her husband didn't tell us that," said the girl.
6829_68769_000051_000000 "He was fairly prosperous before that, for mrs Rogers was an energetic and sensible woman, and kept old Will hard at work.
6829_68769_000051_000001 One morning she tried to light the fire with kerosene, and lost her sight.
6829_68769_000051_000002 Then Rogers wouldn't do anything but lead her around, and wait upon her, and the place went to rack and ruin."
6829_68769_000052_000000 "I understand now," said Beth.
6829_68769_000053_000000 "Lucy could have looked after her mother," said young Bates, "but old Will was stubborn and wouldn't let her.
6829_68769_000053_000001 So the girl saw something must be done and went to work.
6829_68769_000053_000002 That's how all the trouble came about."
6829_68769_000054_000000 He spoke simply, but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them. It was evident that his feelings were deeper than he cared to make evident.
6829_68769_000055_000000 "Whose name did you sign to the check?" asked Kenneth.
6829_68769_000056_000001 He is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern.
6829_68769_000056_000003 I was bookkeeper, so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature.
6829_68769_000056_000005 I discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant.
6829_68769_000056_000006 But Marshall never even thanked me.
6829_68769_000056_000007 He only discharged the man who was responsible for the fire."
6829_68769_000057_000000 "How long ago were you arrested?" asked Beth.
6829_68769_000058_000000 "It's nearly two weeks now.
6829_68769_000058_000001 But I'll have a trial in a few days, they say.
6829_68769_000058_000002 My crime is so serious that the circuit judge has to sit on the case."
6829_68769_000060_000000 "She's at home, I suppose.
6829_68769_000060_000001 I haven't heard from her since the day she came here to see me-right after my arrest."
6829_68769_000061_000001 It was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth.
6829_68769_000062_000000 "I'm going to see mr Marshall," said Kenneth, "and discover what I can do to assist you."
6829_68769_000063_000000 "Thank you, sir.
6829_68769_000063_000001 It won't be much, but I'm grateful to find a friend. I'm guilty, you know, and there's no one to blame but myself."
6829_68769_000065_000002 I've seen lots of that kind in my day.
6829_68769_000065_000003 You don't smoke, do you, mr Forbes?"
6829_68769_000066_000000 "No, mr Markham."
6829_68769_000067_000002 And it ruins a man's disposition."
6829_68769_000068_000000 The mill was at the outskirts of the town.
6829_68769_000068_000001 It was a busy place, perhaps the busiest in the whole of the Eighth District, and in it were employed a large number of men.
6829_68769_000068_000003 The manager was in, Kenneth and Beth learned, but could not see them until he had signed the letters he had dictated for the noon mail.
6829_68769_000070_000000 He looked up rather ungraciously, but motioned them to be seated.
6829_68769_000071_000001 Forbes, of Elmhurst?" he asked, glancing at the card Kenneth had sent in.
6829_68769_000072_000000 "Yes, sir."
6829_68769_000073_000000 "I've been bothered already over your election campaign," resumed the manager, arranging his papers in a bored manner.
6829_68769_000073_000002 You may as well understand, sir, that I stand for the Democratic candidate, and have no sympathy with your side."
6829_68769_000074_000000 "That doesn't interest me, especially, sir," answered Kenneth, smiling. "I'm not electioneering just now.
6829_68769_000074_000001 I've come to talk with you about young Gates."
6829_68769_000075_000001 Well, sir, what about him?"
6829_68769_000077_000000 "He's a forger, mr Forbes; a deliberate criminal."
6829_68769_000078_000000 "I admit that.
6829_68769_000078_000001 But he's very young, and his youth is largely responsible for his folly."
6829_68769_000079_000000 "He stole my money."
6829_68769_000081_000000 "And he deserves a term in state's prison."
6829_68769_000082_000001 Nevertheless, I should like to save him," said Kenneth.
6829_68769_000082_000002 "His trial has not yet taken place, and instead of your devoting considerable of your valuable time appearing against him it would be much simpler to settle the matter right here and now."
6829_68769_000083_000000 "In what way, mr Forbes?"
6829_68769_000084_000000 "I'll make your money loss good."
6829_68769_000085_000000 "It has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance."
6829_68769_000086_000001 I'll pay twice sixty dollars for the delivery to me of the forged check, and the withdrawal of the prosecution."
6829_68769_000088_000000 "I'll pay all the costs besides."
6829_68769_000089_000001 Why should you do all this?"
6829_68769_000090_000000 "I have my own reasons, mr Marshall.
6829_68769_000090_000001 Please look at the matter from a business standpoint.
6829_68769_000090_000002 If you send the boy to prison you will still suffer the loss of the money.
6829_68769_000090_000003 By compromising with me you can recover your loss and are paid for your annoyance."
6829_68769_000091_000000 "You're right.
6829_68769_000091_000001 Give me a check for a hundred and fifty, and I'll turn over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings."
6829_68769_000092_000000 Kenneth hesitated a moment.
6829_68769_000092_000001 He detested the grasping disposition that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young Gates.
6829_68769_000093_000000 Beth, uneasy at his silence, nudged him.
6829_68769_000094_000000 "Pay it, Ken," she whispered.
6829_68769_000096_000001 He also wrote a note to his lawyer directing him to withdraw the prosecution.
6829_68769_000097_000000 Kenneth and Beth went away quite happy with their success, and the manager stood in his little window and watched them depart.
6829_68769_000097_000001 There was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face.
6829_68769_000098_000000 "Of all the easy marks I ever encountered," muttered mr Marshall, "this young Forbes is the easiest.
6829_68769_000098_000001 Why, he's a fool, that's what he is.
6829_68769_000098_000002 He might have had that forged check for the face of it, if he'd been sharp. You wouldn't catch 'Rast Hopkins doing such a fool stunt.
6829_68769_000100_000000 "I'm so glad, Ken-so glad!
6829_68769_000100_000001 And to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars!
6829_68769_000100_000002 And now we must find the girl."
6829_68771_000003_000000 CHAPTER twelve
6829_68771_000004_000000 BETH MEETS A REBUFF
6829_68771_000005_000000 The campaign was now growing warm.
6829_68771_000005_000001 mr Hopkins had come to realize that he had "the fight of his life" on his hands, and that defeat meant his political ruin.
6829_68771_000006_000000 He did not laugh at his opponents any longer.
6829_68771_000006_000001 To himself he admitted their shrewdness and activity and acknowledged that an experienced head was managing their affairs.
6829_68771_000008_000000 This canvass was quite satisfactory, for final report showed only about a hundred majority for Forbes.
6829_68771_000009_000000 But, to offset this cheering condition, the Democratic agents who made the canvass reported that there was an air of uncertainty throughout the district, and that many of those who declared for Hopkins were lukewarm and faint hearted, and might easily be induced to change their votes. This was what must be prevented.
6829_68771_000010_000000 The Democratic Committee figured out a way to do this.
6829_68771_000010_000001 Monroe County, where both Forbes and Hopkins resided, was one of the Democratic strongholds of the State.
6829_68771_000010_000004 A man named Cummings was the Republican and Seth Reynolds, the liveryman, the Democratic nominee.
6829_68771_000010_000005 Under ordinary conditions Reynolds was sure to be elected, but the Committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect Hopkins.
6829_68771_000010_000007 This "trading votes," which was often done, was considered by the politicians quite legitimate.
6829_68771_000010_000008 The only thing necessary was to "fix" Seth Reynolds, and this Hopkins arranged personally.
6829_68771_000010_000009 The office of Sheriff would pay about two thousand a year, and this sum Hopkins agreed to pay the liveryman and so relieve him of all the annoyance of earning it.
6829_68771_000011_000001 mr Cummings, who was to profit by the deal, was called to a private consultation and agreed to slaughter Kenneth Forbes to secure votes for himself.
6829_68771_000011_000002 It was thought that this clever arrangement would easily win the fight for Hopkins.
6829_68771_000012_000000 But the Honorable Erastus had no intention of "taking chances," or "monkeying with fate," as he tersely expressed it.
6829_68771_000012_000001 Every scheme known to politicians must be worked, and none knew the intricate game better than Hopkins.
6829_68771_000012_000002 This was why he held several long conferences with his friend Marshall, the manager at the mill.
6829_68771_000012_000003 And this was why Kenneth and Beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy.
6829_68771_000012_000004 mr Hopkins had picked her up from the path leading from the rear gate of the Elmhurst grounds, and she had given him accurate information concerning the movements of the girl campaigners.
6829_68771_000012_000005 The description she gave of the coming reception to the Woman's Political League was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them, and thus mr Hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were.
6829_68771_000014_000000 Louise was making great preparations to entertain the Woman's Political League, an organization she had herself founded, the members of which were wives of farmers in the district.
6829_68771_000015_000000 Patsy and Beth supported their cousin loyally and assisted in the preparations.
6829_68771_000015_000001 The Fairview band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce, and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests.
6829_68771_000015_000002 Tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served.
6829_68771_000016_000000 The day of the entertainment was as sunny and mild as heart could desire.
6829_68771_000017_000000 By ten o'clock the farm wagons began to drive up, loaded with women and children, for all were invited except the grown men.
6829_68771_000018_000000 The gardens and grounds were gaily decorated with Chinese and Japanese lanterns, streamers and Forbes banners.
6829_68771_000018_000003 A speakers' stand, profusely decorated, had been erected on the lawn, and hundreds of folding chairs provided for seats.
6829_68771_000019_000000 "We ought to have more attendants, Beth," said Louise, approaching her cousin.
6829_68771_000019_000001 "Won't you run into the house and see if Martha can't spare one or two more maids?"
6829_68771_000021_000000 So she greeted the girl cordially, and said:
6829_68771_000022_000000 "Maids?
6829_68771_000022_000002 I counted on Eliza Parsons, the new girl I hired for the linen room and to do mending; but Eliza said she had a headache this morning and couldn't stand the sun, So I let her off.
6829_68771_000022_000003 But she didn't seem very sick to me."
6829_68771_000023_000001 "Where is she, Martha?
6829_68771_000023_000002 I'll go and ask her."
6829_68771_000026_000000 "Come in."
6829_68771_000027_000000 The girl entered, and gave an involuntary cry of surprise.
6829_68771_000027_000001 Standing before her was the young girl she had seen riding with mr Hopkins-the girl she had declared to be the missing daughter of mrs Rogers.
6829_68771_000028_000000 For a moment Beth stood staring, while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face.
6829_68771_000029_000001 "Aren't you Lucy Rogers?"
6829_68771_000030_000000 The maid raised her eyebrows with a gesture of genuine surprise.
6829_68771_000030_000001 Then she gave a little laugh, and replied:
6829_68771_000031_000000 "No, Miss Beth.
6829_68771_000031_000001 I'm Elizabeth Parsons."
6829_68771_000032_000000 "But it can't be," protested the girl.
6829_68771_000032_000001 "How do you know my name, and why haven't I seen you here before?"
6829_68771_000033_000001 "I obtained the situation only a few days ago.
6829_68771_000033_000002 I attend to the household mending, you know, and care for the linen.
6829_68771_000034_000001 "Where is your home?"
6829_68771_000035_000000 For the first time the maid seemed a little confused, and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor.
6829_68771_000036_000000 "Will you excuse my answering that question?" she asked.
6829_68771_000037_000001 "Why cannot you answer it?"
6829_68771_000038_000000 "Excuse me, please.
6829_68771_000038_000002 I have a headache."
6829_68771_000039_000000 She sat down in a rocking chair, and clasping her hands in her lap, rocked slowly back and forth.
6829_68771_000040_000000 "I'm sorry," said Beth.
6829_68771_000040_000001 "I hoped you would be able to assist me on the lawn.
6829_68771_000040_000002 There are so many people that we can't give them proper attention."
6829_68771_000041_000000 Eliza Parsons shook her head.
6829_68771_000042_000001 "I abhor crowds.
6829_68771_000042_000002 They-they excite me, in some way, and I-I can't bear them.
6829_68771_000042_000003 You must excuse me."
6829_68771_000043_000000 Beth looked at the strange girl without taking the hint to retire. Somehow, she could not rid herself of the impression that whether or not she was mistaken in supposing Eliza to be the missing Lucy, she had stumbled upon a sphinx whose riddle was well worth solving.
6829_68771_000044_000001 She even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted.
6829_68771_000044_000002 Beth was a beautiful girl-the handsomest of the three cousins, by far; yet Eliza surpassed her in natural charm, and seemed well aware of the fact.
6829_68771_000044_000003 Her manner was neither independent nor assertive, but rather one of well bred composure and calm reliance.
6829_68771_000044_000004 Beth felt that she was intruding and knew that she ought to go; yet some fascination held her to the spot.
6829_68771_000044_000005 Her eyes wandered to the maid's hands.
6829_68771_000044_000006 However her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness, these hands told a different story.
6829_68771_000044_000007 The thin fingers clasped and unclasped in little spasmodic jerks and belied the quiet smile upon the face above them.
6829_68771_000045_000000 "I wish," said Beth, slowly, "I knew you."
6829_68771_000046_000000 A sudden wave of scarlet swept over Eliza's face.
6829_68771_000046_000001 She rose quickly to her feet, with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath.
6829_68771_000047_000000 "I wish I knew myself," she cried, fiercely.
6829_68771_000048_000000 "I will go," said Beth, a little frightened at the passionate appeal.
6829_68771_000049_000000 Eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam, and a key clicked in the lock.
6930_75918_000000_000001 Night.
6930_75918_000001_000000 Concord returned to its place amidst the tents.
6930_75918_000003_000000 "Cruelly."
6930_75918_000004_000000 "Bodily, I suppose?"
6930_75918_000005_000000 "Yes; bodily."
6930_75918_000009_000000 "No; I wish to talk to you."
6930_75918_000015_000000 "I suspect."
6930_75918_000017_000000 "One could almost swear to it, to observe him."
6930_75918_000023_000000 "Nay, where it does exist."
6930_75918_000029_000000 "What do you mean?"
6930_75918_000031_000000 "I am fatigued."
6930_75918_000032_000001 Believe me, it is not fatigue that saddens you to night."
6930_75918_000034_000000 "What annoyance?"
6930_75918_000035_000000 "That of this evening."
6930_75918_000038_000000 "Yes, you are right; but I do not think any danger is to be apprehended from Buckingham."
6930_75918_000039_000000 "No; still he is intrusive.
6930_75918_000042_000000 "What I said to him, count," replied Raoul, "I will repeat to you. Listen to me.
6930_75918_000048_000000 "Do you wish it?"
6930_75918_000050_000000 "I leave you, then," said Raoul, as he withdrew.
6930_75918_000050_000001 The count advanced a step towards his friend, and pressed him warmly in his arms.
6930_76324_000002_000000 They were certainly no nearer the solution of their problem.
6930_76324_000002_000004 These two cherubic infants had both big brown eyes, fat red cheeks, and adorable, fluffy golden curls.
6930_76324_000003_000000 "The poor little things!" cried Cynthia.
6930_76324_000004_000000 "I've got it!" she announced.
6930_76324_000005_000000 "You must be right," admitted Cynthia.
6930_76324_000005_000001 "I thought we were 'stumped' again when I first saw that picture, but it's been of some use, after all.
6930_76324_000006_000003 Presently she spoke:
6930_76324_000010_000004 But let's go and finish our studying now, and get that out of the way.
6930_76324_000014_000003 First they took turns sweeping, as best they could, with a very ancient and frowsy broom, the thick, moth eaten carpet.
6930_76324_000019_000003 But they'll have to do.
6930_76324_000019_000004 I wonder, though, if people could see the light from the street, through any chinks in the boarding?"
6930_76324_000020_000000 "Of course not," said Joyce.
6930_76324_000022_000000 "Perhaps that's so," admitted Joyce, thoughtfully.
6930_76324_000023_000003 There isn't a doubt but what that baby was she."
6930_76324_000025_000001 "I'm just dog tired!"
6930_76324_000026_000003 I just touched something soft!" On the instant, Joyce was at her side with the candle.
6930_76324_000030_000000 "'tuesday april sixteenth eighteen sixty one.'"
6930_81414_000001_000000 CHAPTER eleven
6930_81414_000002_000000 DARK DREAMS AND NIGHT SHADOWS
6930_81414_000009_000000 I stood alone.
6930_81414_000011_000000 What was that?
6930_81414_000013_000000 What could it be?
6930_81414_000014_000003 It did not beckon, or indeed move at all; it was as still as the hand of death.
6930_81414_000019_000003 Gradually I knew I was mastering him-then all was blank.
6930_81414_000020_000001 A flash of light.
6930_81414_000028_000001 I-I do not know."
6930_81414_000029_000000 "But you have been together."
6930_81414_000031_000001 What is that in your hand?"
6930_81414_000037_000001 "Have we been together?" "That's his knife, at any rate.
6930_81414_000038_000001 "Look, mr Blake; do you recognize this?"
6930_81414_000041_000001 Here is his scarf, which has evidently been strained, and on it are spots of blood, while all around are marks indicating a struggle.
6930_81414_000041_000002 I say you do know what this means, and you must tell us."
6930_81414_000042_000003 Had I? Had I?
6930_81414_000043_000001 "I think I am ill."
6930_81414_000046_000004 Undoubtedly the Egyptian knew too much for Voltaire, and so I was made a tool whereby he could be freed from troublesome obstacles.
6930_81414_000047_000000 My position was too terrible.
6930_81414_000047_000003 Then I fell down at Tom Temple's feet.
6930_81414_000048_000002 Then I heard Tom say-
6930_81414_000049_000000 "He's better now.
6938_70848_000002_000001 In the morning we woke to window ledges heaped white, and snowflakes falling so whirling thick that it was impossible to see ten feet ahead.
6938_70848_000002_000004 In spite of Revolution, all Russia plunging dizzily into the unknown and terrible future, joy swept the city with the coming of the snow.
6938_70848_000003_000000 Even the sun came out, pale and watery, at noon.
6938_70848_000003_000002 The life of the city grew gay, and the very Revolution ran swifter....
6938_70848_000004_000003 Right away!"
6938_70848_000006_000000 "You are no better than murderers!" he cried.
6938_70848_000006_000001 "Shooting down your Russian brothers on the streets!"
6938_70848_000010_000000 The captain shouted at the top of his voice.
6938_70848_000010_000002 You should remain neutral!
6938_70848_000010_000003 Who are you to destroy the legal Government?
6938_70848_000010_000005 A German-"
6938_70848_000011_000000 "Who are you?
6938_70848_000012_000001 "All right!" said he.
6938_70848_000012_000002 "You call yourselves the people of Russia.
6938_70848_000012_000005 Wait until the peasants-"
6938_70848_000013_000000 "Yes," they cried, "wait until the peasants speak.
6938_70848_000013_000002 Aren't they workingmen like ourselves?"
6938_70848_000014_000001 While the peasants had been politically backward, still they had their own peculiar ideas, and they constituted more than eighty per cent of the people of Russia.
6938_70848_000017_000001 He must study the aspects of the agrarian problem in the province.
6938_70848_000019_000001 Who administers the confiscated land-the former proprietor, or the Land Committees?
6938_70848_000020_000001 What has been done with the agricultural machinery and with the farm animals?
6938_70848_000021_000001 Has the ground cultivated by the peasants been augmented?
6938_70848_000022_000001 How much and in what respect does the amount of land now under cultivation differ from the amount fixed by the Government as an average minimum?
6938_70848_000025_000001 It is desirable that agricultural properties well appointed and well organised should be administered by Soviets composed of the regular employees of those properties, under the direction of competent agricultural scientists.
6938_70848_000029_000000 The great hall was jammed with people and shaken with continual clamour; deep, stubborn bitterness divided the delegates into angry groups.
6938_70848_000029_000003 The galleries were thronged with workers-who, in Russia, still remember their peasant origin....
6938_70848_000031_000001 Whereupon the old Executive Committee left the hall....
6938_70848_000035_000003 We don't recognise your Government!"
6938_70848_000036_000001 Finally, except for the right side of the hall, the demonstration wore itself out somewhat.
6938_70848_000038_000000 "However," he went on, in an unmoved voice, "nobody will deny that the present Government of Russia has been formed by the Bolshevik party-" he had to wait a moment, "so that for all purposes it is the same thing...." Here the right benches broke into deafening clamour, but the centre and left were curious, and compelled silence.
6938_70848_000039_000000 Lenin's argument was simple.
6938_70848_000039_000004 Are you going to allow the ranks of the proletariat to be divided?
6938_70848_000041_000001 Anybody who attempts to destroy the Soviets is guilty of an anti democratic and counter revolutionary act.
6938_70848_000042_000001 Only two months before considered an extreme revolutionist, and very popular with the peasants, he was now called to check the dangerous drift of the Congress toward the Left.
6938_70848_000043_000000 His first act was to bitterly rebuke the Executive Committee for leaving the Congress.
6938_70848_000044_000000 "Comrades!
6938_70848_000045_000001 Cries, "Down with the Bolsheviki!"
6938_70848_000046_000002 Where does such an accusation come from?
6938_70848_000046_000003 Show me the source!"
6938_70848_000049_000002 After a brief conversation I left-and that's all! Let any one present make such an accusation!"
6938_70848_000052_000000 Meanwhile, the question of the status of the Executive Committee was agitating all minds.
6938_70848_000052_000001 By declaring the assembly "Extraordinary Conference," it had been planned to block the reelection of the Executive Committee.
6938_70848_000052_000002 But this worked both ways; the Left Socialist Revolutionists decided that if the Congress had no power over the Executive Committee, then the Executive Committee had no power over the Congress.
6938_70848_000054_000000 On the twenty seventh occurred the debate on the Land question, which revealed the differences between the agrarian programme of the Bolsheviki and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries.
6938_70848_000055_000005 The peasants understood the exact meaning of the Revolution-they tried to turn words into action....
6938_70848_000056_000000 "The recent events," said the orator, "do not indicate a simple riot, or a 'Bolshevik adventure,' but on the contrary, a real popular rising, which has been greeted with sympathy by the whole country....
6938_70848_000057_000001 From the first days, the Bolsheviki declared that the peasants should take over the land 'by revolutionary mass action.' This is nothing but anarchy; the land can be taken over in an organised manner....
6938_70848_000058_000000 "The Land decree of the Congress of Soviets is identical in its fundamentals with the decisions of the first Peasants' Congress.
6938_70848_000059_000001 However, no harm has been done by that; for the Land Committees are paying no attention to the Soviet decrees, but are putting into operation their own practical decisions-decisions based on the will of the vast majority of the peasants....
6938_70848_000060_000001 But will the Constituent Assembly desire to do the will of the Russian peasants?
6938_70848_000060_000002 Of that we cannot be sure....
6938_70848_000060_000004 The Constituent Assembly will not dare to break with the will of the people...."
6938_70848_000061_000000 Followed him Lenin, listened to now with absorbing intensity.
6938_70848_000061_000001 "At this moment we are not only trying to solve the Land question, but the question of Social Revolution-not only here in Russia, but all over the world.
6938_70848_000063_000001 The Socialist political party-this is the vanguard of the working class; it must not allow itself to be halted by the lack of education of the mass average, but it must lead the masses, using the Soviets as organs of revolutionary initiative....
6938_70848_000064_000001 If Compromise continues, the Revolution disappears.
6938_70848_000065_000000 "We Bolsheviki have not changed our Land programme; we have not given up the abolition of private property in the land, and we do not intend to do so.
6938_70848_000066_000000 "We invite the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to enter that coalition, insisting, however, that they cease looking backward, and that they break with the 'conciliators' of their party....
6938_70848_000067_000000 "As far as the Constituent Assembly is concerned, it is true, as the preceding speaker has said, that the work of the Constituent will depend on the revolutionary determination of the masses.
6938_70848_000067_000001 I say, 'Count on that revolutionary determination, but don't forget your gun!'"
6938_70848_000072_000000 For these reasons the Peasants' Congress sustains entirely the Revolution of november seventh... as a social revolution, and expresses its unalterable will to put into operation, with whatever modifications are necessary, but without any hesitation, the social transformation of the Russian Republic.
6938_70848_000073_000001 From now on, in the Russian Republic, all the organisation and administration of the State, from top to bottom, must rest on that union.
6938_70848_000074_000000 The reactionaries of the Executive Committee no longer dared openly to appear.
6938_70848_000074_000002 He was invited to sit on the platform....
6938_70848_000075_000001 It seemed to me as if the Congress were hopelessly deadlocked.
6938_70848_000077_000002 The Dumas and Zemstvos were dropped.
6938_70848_000077_000003 Lenin and Trotzky remained in the Government, and the Military Revolutionary Committee continued to function.
6938_70848_000078_000002 The old Executive Committee had withdrawn, and was holding a rump convention of its own in another room of the same building, made up of bolting delegates and representatives of the Army Committees.
6938_70848_000079_000001 He knew that an agreement with the Bolsheviki was being discussed, but he did not know that it had been concluded.
6938_70848_000080_000000 He spoke to the rump convention.
6938_70848_000080_000002 Now people accuse Kerensky; they forget that he was raised to power, not only by the Soviets, but also by the popular masses....
6938_70848_000081_000001 The savages set up gods to which they pray, and which they punish if one of their prayers is not answered....
6938_70848_000081_000002 That is what is happening at this moment.... Yesterday Kerensky; to day Lenin and Trotzky; another to morrow....
6938_70848_000082_000000 "We have proposed to both Kerensky and the Bolsheviki to retire from the power.
6938_70848_000083_000000 "If the Bolsheviki succeed, or if they fail, the fate of Russia will not be changed.
6938_70848_000083_000001 The Russian villages understand perfectly what they want, and they are now carrying out their own measures....
6938_70848_000086_000000 "Moreover, I want to warn you now that the Bolsheviki will never accept your demands...."
6938_70848_000087_000000 He was interrupted by a great burst of laughter; and realising the situation, he left the platform and the room, taking his popularity with him....
6938_70848_000088_000003 At every mention of the word "union" there was ecstatic applause....
6938_70848_000089_000000 Then Boris Reinstein, delegate of the American Socialist Labor Party: "The day of the union of the Congress of Peasants and the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies is one of the great days of the Revolution.
6938_70848_000089_000001 The sound of it will ring with resounding echoes throughout the whole world-in Paris, in London, and across the ocean-in New York.
6938_70848_000089_000002 This union will fill with happiness the hearts of all toilers.
6938_70848_000091_000001 And with the shout, "Long live the end of civil war!
6938_70848_000091_000002 Long live the United Democracy!" the peasants poured out of the building.
6938_70848_000094_000000 "Long live the Revolutionary Army!
6938_70848_000094_000002 Long live the Peasants!"
6938_70848_000097_000001 The other old peasant spoke to his comrade, "I am not tired," he said.
6938_70848_000102_000003 There is no force in the world which can put out the fire of the Revolution!
6938_70848_000104_000000 With biting sarcasm he went on to speak of the Allied diplomats, till then contemptuous of Russia's invitation to an armistice, which had been accepted by the Central Powers.
6938_70848_000105_000002 If we are broken, then it will be in defending our flag...."
6938_70848_000109_000001 "I greet you with the christening of a new Russian life and freedom!"
7018_75789_000000_000000 When it was the Five Hundred and Sixty first Night,
7018_75789_000001_000003 Then I loaded it with the goods, precious ores and jewels: and the union pearls which were like gravel and the best of the ambergris crude and pure, together with what I had collected on the island and what was left me of victual and wild herbs.
7018_75789_000001_000004 Lastly I lashed a piece of wood on either side, to serve me as oars; and launched it, and embarking, did according to the saying of the poet,
7018_75789_000003_000000 My boat raft drifted with the stream, I pondering the issue of my affair; and the drifting ceased not till I came to the place where it disappeared beneath the mountain.
7018_75789_000003_000005 But I was delighted at my escape from the river.
7018_75789_000003_000006 When they saw I understood them not and made them no answer, one of them came forward and said to me in Arabic, "Peace be with thee, O my brother!
7018_75789_000003_000009 Who are ye and what country is this?" "O my brother," answered he, "we are husbandmen and tillers of the soil, who came out to water our fields and plantations; and, finding thee asleep on this raft, laid hold of it and made it fast by us, against thou shouldst awake at thy leisure.
7018_75789_000004_000000 When it was the Five Hundred and Sixty second Night,
7018_75789_000005_000002 So I consorted with the chief of the islanders, and they paid me the utmost respect.
7018_75789_000005_000006 One day, the King himself asked me of the fashions and form of government of my country, and I acquainted him with the circumstance of the Caliph's sway in the city of Baghdad and the justice of his rule.
7018_75789_000005_000009 Then he bestowed on me great riches from his treasuries and charged me with a magnificent present for the Caliph Harun al Rashid.
7018_75789_000005_000010 Moreover he gave me a sealed letter, saying, "Carry this with thine own hand to the Commander of the Faithful and give him many salutations from us!" "Hearing and obedience," I replied.
7018_75789_000005_000016 Then I took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchants aforesaid.
7018_75789_000005_000017 We sailed with a fair wind, committing ourselves to the care of Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) and by His permission arrived at Bassorah, where I passed a few days and nights equipping myself and packing up my bales.
7018_75789_000005_000020 For state processions a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant, eleven cubits high: and upon this he sitteth having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks, on his right hand and on his left.
7018_75789_000005_000025 Then he conferred on me exceeding great favours, and I repaired to my quarter and entered my home, where I warehoused all my goods and possessions. Presently, my friends came to me and I distributed presents among my family and gave alms and largesse; after which I yielded myself to joyance and enjoyment, mirth and merry making, and forgot all that I had suffered.
7018_75789_000006_000000 When it was the Five Hundred and Sixty third Night,
7018_75789_000007_000000 She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sindbad the Seaman had related the history of what befel him in his sixth voyage, and all the company had dispersed, Sindbad the Landsman went home and slept as of wont.
7018_75789_000007_000001 Next day he rose and prayed the dawn prayer and repaired to his namesake's house where, after the company was all assembled, the host began to relate
7018_75789_000008_000000 The Seventh Voyage of Sindbad the Seaman.
7018_75789_000009_000002 So we covered the bales with our cloaks and garments and drugget and canvas, lest they be spoiled by the rain, and betook ourselves to prayer and supplication to Almighty Allah and humbled ourselves before Him for deliverance from the peril that was upon us.
7018_75789_000009_000006 Presently we heard a terrible great cry like the loud pealing thunder, whereat we were terror struck and became as dead men, giving ourselves up for lost.
7018_75789_000009_000009 So we besought the Almighty and called for succour upon His Apostle (on whom be blessing and peace!), when suddenly a violent squall of wind arose and smote the ship, which rose out of the water and settled upon a great reef, the haunt of sea monsters, where it broke up and fell asunder into planks and all and everything on board were plunged into the sea.
7018_75789_000009_000010 As for me, I tore off all my clothes but my gown and swam a little way, till I happened upon one of the ship's planks whereto I clung and bestrode it like a horse, whilst the winds and the waters sported with me and the waves carried me up and cast me down; and I was in most piteous plight for fear and distress and hunger and thirst.
7021_79730_000043_000000 THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT.
7021_79730_000044_000001 To suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that, is entirely to mistake its nature and design.
7021_79730_000044_000003 The object of this work is, accordingly, not to show how the gentle methods which will be brought to view can be employed as a substitute for such authority, but how they can be made to aid in establishing and maintaining it.
7021_79730_000046_000000 There are three different modes of management customarily employed by parents as means of inducing their children to comply with their requirements.
7021_79730_000046_000001 They are,
7021_79730_000047_000000 one.
7021_79730_000047_000001 Government by Manoeuvring and Artifice.
7021_79730_000048_000001 By Reason and Affection.
7021_79730_000049_000000 three.
7021_79730_000049_000001 By Authority.
7021_79730_000051_000001 Many mothers manage their children by means of tricks and contrivances, more or less adroit, designed to avoid direct issues with them, and to beguile them, as it were, into compliance with their wishes.
7021_79730_000051_000003 She brings down her bonnet and shawl by stealth, and before the chaise comes to the door she sends Mary out into the garden with her sister, under pretense of showing her a bird's nest which is not there, trusting to her sister's skill in diverting the child's mind, and amusing her with something else in the garden, until the chaise has gone.
7021_79730_000052_000000 As the chaise drives away, Mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the door step, her mind in a tumult of excitement, in which hatred of the doctor, distrust and suspicion of her mother, disappointment, vexation, and ill humor, surge and swell among those delicate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend-doing perhaps an irreparable injury.
7021_79730_000053_000000 In respect to her statement that she was going to the doctor's, it may, or may not, have been true.
7021_79730_000055_000001 The theory of many mothers is that they must govern their children by the influence of reason and affection.
7021_79730_000056_000000 "Mary, your father and I are going out to ride this afternoon, and I am going to explain it all to you why you can not go too.
7021_79730_000056_000002 You love mamma, I am sure, and wish to have her get well soon. So you will be a good girl, I know, and not make any trouble, but will stay at home contentedly-won't you?
7021_79730_000056_000003 Then I shall love you, and your papa will love you, and after I get well we will take you to ride with us some day."
7021_79730_000057_000000 The mother, in managing the case in this way, relies partly on convincing the reason of the child, and partly on an appeal to her affection.
7021_79730_000059_000001 By the third method the mother secures the compliance of the child by a direct exercise of authority.
7021_79730_000060_000000 "Mary, your father and I are going out to ride this afternoon, and I am sorry, for your sake, that we can not take you with us."
7021_79730_000061_000000 "Why can't you take me?" asks Mary.
7021_79730_000062_000000 "I can not tell you why, now," replies the mother, "but perhaps I will explain it to you after I come home.
7021_79730_000063_000000 Then, if she observes any expression of discontent or insubmission in Mary's countenance, the mother would add,
7021_79730_000065_000002 Those children only attempt to carry their points by noisy and violent demonstrations who find, by experience, that such measures are usually successful.
7021_79730_000065_000003 A child, even, who has become once accustomed to them, will soon drop them if she finds, owing to a change in the system of management, that they now never succeed.
7021_79730_000065_000004 And a child who never, from the beginning, finds any efficiency in them, never learns to employ them at all.
7021_79730_000067_000001 But the influences secured by these means form, at the best, but a sandy foundation for filial obedience to rest upon.
7021_79740_000002_000000 DELLA AND THE DOLLS.
7021_79740_000003_000000 This book may, perhaps, sometimes fall into the hands of persons who have, temporarily or otherwise, the charge of young children without any absolute authority over them, or any means, or even any right, to enforce their commands, as was the case, in fact, with the older brothers or sister referred to in the preceding illustrations.
7021_79740_000003_000001 To such persons, these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will, or rather of yielding to their influence, are specially useful.
7021_79740_000003_000002 Such persons may be interested in the manner in which Delia made use of the children's dolls as a means of guiding and governing their little mothers.
7021_79740_000005_000001 Besides dressing and undressing them, and playing take them out to excursions and visits, they used to talk with them a great deal, and give them much useful and valuable information and instruction.
7021_79740_000007_000000 Now Delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls.
7021_79740_000009_000001 If Delia had attempted to give precisely the same lecture to the children themselves, they would very soon have become restless and uneasy, and it would have made very little impression upon them.
7021_79740_000009_000002 But being addressed to the dolls, they would be greatly interested in it, and would listen with the utmost attention; and there is no doubt that the counsels and instructions which she gave made a much stronger impression upon their minds than if they had been addressed directly to the children themselves. To give an idea of these conversations I will report one of them in full.
7021_79740_000010_000000 "How do you do, my children?" she said, on one such occasion.
7021_79740_000010_000002 How nice you look!
7021_79740_000010_000003 You have come, Andella (Andella was the name of Jane's doll), to make Rosalie a visit.
7021_79740_000010_000004 I am very glad.
7021_79740_000010_000005 You will have a very pleasant time, I am sure; because you never quarrel.
7021_79740_000010_000006 I observe that, when you both wish for the same thing, you don't quarrel for it and try to pull it away from one another; but one waits like a lady until the other has done with it.
7021_79740_000011_000000 Then, turning to Jane, she asked, in a somewhat altered tone, "Has she been a good girl, Jane?"
7021_79740_000013_000000 "Ah!" said Della in a tone of great concern, and looking again at Andella, "I heard that you had been sick.
7021_79740_000013_000002 And you don't look very well now.
7021_79740_000015_000002 Nothing more was necessary except to shake up the mixture in order to facilitate the process of solution, and the medicine was ready.
7021_79740_000017_000000 Delia was accustomed to use the dolls not only for the purpose of instruction, but sometimes for reproof, in many ingenious ways.
7021_79740_000017_000001 For instance, one day the children had been playing upon the piazza with blocks and other playthings, and finally had gone into the house, leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza, instead of putting them away in their places, as they ought to have done.
7021_79740_000017_000002 They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.
7021_79740_000018_000001 I want you to come with me.
7021_79740_000018_000002 There is a secret-something I would not have them know on any account."
7021_79740_000019_000000 So saying, she led the way on tiptoe, followed by the children out of the room, and round by a circuitous route to the piazza.
7021_79740_000020_000000 "There!" said she, pointing to the playthings; "see! all your playthings left out!
7021_79740_000020_000001 Put them away quick before Andella and Rosalie see them.
7021_79740_000020_000002 I would not have them know that their mothers leave their playthings about in that way for any consideration.
7021_79740_000020_000003 They would think that they might do so too, and that would make you a great deal of trouble.
7021_79740_000020_000005 Put these playthings all away quick, and carefully, and we will not let them know any thing about your leaving them out."
7021_79740_000021_000000 So the children went to work with great alacrity, and put the playthings all away.
7021_79740_000021_000001 And this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been.
7021_79740_000022_000000 Besides, a scolding would have made them unhappy, and this did not make them unhappy at all; it amused and entertained them.
7021_79740_000022_000001 If you can lead children to cure themselves of their faults in such a way that they shall have a good time in doing it, there is a double gain.
7021_79759_000001_000000 CONCLUSION.
7021_79759_000004_000004 You have made a life-long change, if not in the very structure, at least in the permanent furnishing of her mind, and performed a work that can never by any possibility be undone.
7021_79759_000004_000005 The images which have been awakened in her mind, the emotions connected with them, and the effect of these images and emotions upon her faculties of imagination and conception, will infuse a life into them which will make her, in respect to this aspect of her spiritual nature, a different being as long as she lives.
7021_79759_000006_000001 They are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.
7021_79759_000006_000003 Every story, therefore, which you relate to a child to exemplify the principles of justice or goodness takes its place, or, rather, the impression which it makes takes its place, as one of the elements out of which the ideas that are to govern his future life are formed.
7021_79759_000008_000000 For the ideas and generalizations thus mainly formed from the images and impressions received in childhood become, in later years, the elements of the machinery, so to speak, by which all his mental operations are performed.
7021_79759_000008_000001 Thus they seem to constitute more than the mere furniture of the mind; they form, as it were, almost a part of the structure itself.
7021_79759_000009_000001 The pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away, but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain.
7021_79759_000009_000003 Every strong impression which you make upon his perceptive powers must have a very lasting influence, and even the impression itself may, in some cases, be forever indelible.
7021_79759_000010_000002 We can not surrender this trust.
7021_85628_000002_000000 Once upon a time there was a little boy, called Anders, who had a new cap.
7021_85628_000002_000001 And a prettier cap you never could see, for mother herself had knitted it, and nobody could make anything quite as nice as mother could.
7021_85628_000004_000000 His brothers and sisters walked about squinting at him, and their faces grew long with envy.
7021_85628_000004_000001 But Anders cared nothing about that.
7021_85628_000004_000002 He put his hands in his trousers pockets and went out for a walk, for he did not begrudge anybody's seeing how fine he was.
7021_85628_000005_000000 The first person he met was a farm labourer walking alongside a load of peat and smacking at his horse.
7021_85628_000005_000001 He made a bow so deep that his back came near breaking, and he was dumbfounded, I can tell you, when he saw it was nobody but Anders.
7021_85628_000006_000000 "Dear me," he said, "if I did not think it was the gracious little count himself." And then he invited Anders to ride on the peat load.
7021_85628_000007_000000 But when one has a fine red cap with a blue tassel, one is too fine to ride on peat loads, and Anders trotted proudly by.
7021_85628_000008_000000 At the turn of the road he ran up against the tanner's boy, Lars.
7021_85628_000008_000001 He was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife. He gazed and gazed at the cap, and could not keep from fingering the blue tassel.
7021_85628_000009_000000 "Let's swap caps," he said, "and I will give you my jack knife to boot."
7021_85628_000010_000000 Now this knife was a splendid one, though half the blade was gone, and the handle was a little cracked; and Anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife.
7021_85628_000012_000000 And then he said good bye to Lars with a nod; but Lars only made faces at him, for he was very much put out because he could not cheat Anders out of his cap which his mother had made.
7021_85628_000013_000001 She called him a little gentleman and said that he was so fine that he might go to the royal court ball.
7021_85628_000014_000000 "Yes, why not?" thought Anders.
7021_85628_000014_000001 "Seeing that I am so fine, I may as well go and visit the King."
7021_85628_000015_000000 And so he did.
7021_85628_000015_000001 In the palace yard stood two soldiers with shining helmets, and with muskets over their shoulders; and when Anders came, both the muskets were levelled at him.
7021_85628_000016_000000 "Where may you be going?" asked one of the soldiers.
7021_85628_000017_000000 "I am going to the court ball," answered Anders.
7021_85628_000018_000000 "Indeed you are not," said the other soldier, and put his foot forward.
7021_85628_000019_000000 But just at this instant the Princess came tripping across the yard. She was dressed in white silk with bows of ribbon.
7021_85628_000019_000001 When she became aware of Anders and the soldiers, she walked over to them.
7021_85628_000020_000000 "Oh," she said, "he has such an extraordinarily fine cap on his head, that that will do just as well as a uniform."
7021_85628_000021_000001 For, like as not, they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
7021_85628_000022_000000 At the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows.
7021_85628_000022_000001 On huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes, and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters.
7021_85628_000022_000002 The Princess sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses; and she let Anders sit in a golden chair by her side.
7021_85628_000023_000000 "But you must not eat with your cap on your head," she said, and was going to take it off.
7021_85628_000025_000000 "Well, well, give it to me," said the Princess, "and I will give you a kiss."
7021_85628_000026_000000 The Princess certainly was beautiful, and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her, but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition.
7021_85628_000026_000001 He only shook his head.
7021_85628_000027_000000 "Well, but now?" said the Princess; and she filled his pockets with cakes, and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck, and bent down and kissed him.
7021_85628_000029_000000 Then the doors were thrown open, and the King entered with a large suite of gentlemen in glittering uniforms and plumed hats.
7021_85628_000030_000000 He smiled when he saw Anders in the gilt chair.
7021_85628_000031_000000 "That is a very fine cap you have," he said.
7021_85628_000032_000000 "So it is," said Anders.
7021_85628_000032_000001 "And it is made of mother's best yarn, and she knitted it herself, and everybody wants to get it away from me."
7021_85628_000033_000000 "But surely you would like to change caps with me," said the King, and raised his large, heavy gold crown from his head.
7021_85628_000034_000000 Anders did not answer.
7021_85628_000034_000001 He sat as before, and held on to his red cap which everybody was so anxious to get.
7021_85628_000035_000000 With one jump Anders got out of his chair.
7021_85628_000035_000001 He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
7021_85628_000035_000002 He twisted himself like an eel between the outstretched arms of the courtiers, and over the soldiers' muskets he jumped like a little rabbit.
7021_85628_000035_000003 He ran so fast that the Princess's necklace fell off his neck, and all the cakes jumped out of his pockets.
7021_85628_000035_000004 But he had his cap. He still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage.
7021_85628_000036_000000 And his mother took him up in her lap, and he told her all his adventures, and how everybody wanted his cap.
7021_85628_000036_000001 And all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open.
7021_85628_000037_000000 But when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a King's golden crown, he said that Anders was a stupid.
7021_85628_000038_000001 That he had not thought of.
7021_85628_000038_000002 He cuddled up to his mother and asked:
7021_85628_000039_000000 "Mother, was I stupid?"
7021_85628_000040_000000 But his mother hugged him close.
7021_85628_000041_000001 "If you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe, you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap."
7021_85628_000042_000000 Then Anders felt brave again.
7021_85628_000042_000001 He knew well enough that mother's cap was the best cap in all the world.
7105_2330_000003_000003 The day after the trial there was to be a by-election at Nemesis on Hand, and it had been openly announced in the division that if Platterbaff were languishing in gaol on polling day the Government candidate would be "outed" to a certainty.
7105_2330_000003_000007 Of course any sentence which the law might feel compelled to inflict would be followed by an immediate pardon, but it was highly desirable, from the Government's point of view, that the necessity for such an exercise of clemency should not arise.
7105_2330_000003_000010 Hence the anxiety in the crowded Court, and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in Whitehall and Downing Street and other affected centres.
7105_2330_000004_000000 The jury returned from considering their verdict; there was a flutter, an excited murmur, a deathlike hush.
7105_2330_000004_000001 The foreman delivered his message:
7105_2330_000005_000000 "The jury find the prisoner guilty of blowing up the Albert Hall.
7105_2330_000005_000001 The jury wish to add a rider drawing attention to the fact that a by-election is pending in the Parliamentary division of Nemesis on Hand."
7105_2330_000006_000000 "That, of course," said the Government Prosecutor, springing to his feet, "is equivalent to an acquittal?"
7105_2330_000007_000000 "I hardly think so," said the Judge, coldly; "I feel obliged to sentence the prisoner to a week's imprisonment."
7105_2330_000008_000000 "And may the Lord have mercy on the poll," a Junior Counsel exclaimed irreverently.
7105_2330_000009_000000 It was a scandalous sentence, but then the Judge was not on the Ministerial side in politics.
7105_2330_000010_000000 The verdict and sentence were made known to the public at twenty minutes past five in the afternoon; at half past five a dense crowd was massed outside the Prime Minister's residence lustily singing, to the air of "Trelawney":
7105_2330_000012_000000 "Fifteen hundred," said the Prime Minister, with a shudder; "it's too horrible to think of.
7105_2330_000014_000000 "Seven thirty," amended the Prime Minister; "we must avoid any appearance of precipitancy."
7105_2330_000015_000001 He said it was our only chance of getting a telegram 'Radprop is In' to night."
7105_2330_000016_000000 At half past seven the next morning the Prime Minister and the Chief Organiser sat at breakfast, making a perfunctory meal, and awaiting the return of the Home Secretary, who had gone in person to superintend the releasing of Platterbaff.
7105_2330_000016_000001 Despite the earliness of the hour a small crowd had gathered in the street outside, and the horrible menacing Trelawney refrain of the "Fifteen Hundred Voting Men" came in a steady, monotonous chant.
7105_2330_000017_000000 "They will cheer presently when they hear the news," said the Prime Minister hopefully; "hark!
7105_2330_000017_000001 They are booing some one now!
7105_2330_000017_000002 That must be McKenna."
7105_2330_000018_000000 The Home Secretary entered the room a moment later, disaster written on his face.
7105_2330_000019_000000 "He won't go!" he exclaimed.
7105_2330_000020_000000 "Won't go?
7105_2330_000021_000000 "He won't go unless he has a brass band.
7105_2330_000022_000000 "But surely that sort of thing is provided by his supporters and admirers?" said the Prime Minister; "we can hardly be supposed to supply a released prisoner with a brass band.
7105_2330_000024_000000 The telephone squealed shrilly; it was a trunk call from Nemesis.
7105_2330_000025_000001 Is Platterbaff out yet?
7105_2330_000025_000002 In Heaven's name, why-"
7105_2330_000026_000000 The Chief Organiser rang off.
7105_2330_000027_000000 "This is not a moment for standing on dignity," he observed bluntly; "musicians must be supplied at once.
7105_2330_000027_000001 Platterbaff must have his band."
7105_2330_000028_000001 There's a musicians' strike on, I suppose you know."
7105_2330_000030_000000 "I'll try," said the Home Secretary, and went to the telephone.
7105_2330_000031_000000 Eight o'clock struck.
7105_2330_000031_000001 The crowd outside chanted with an increasing volume of sound:
7105_2330_000032_000000 "Will vote the other way."
7105_2330_000033_000000 A telegram was brought in.
7105_2330_000033_000001 It was from the central committee rooms at Nemesis.
7105_2330_000033_000002 "Losing twenty votes per minute," was its brief message.
7105_2330_000034_000000 Ten o'clock struck.
7105_2330_000034_000002 Without a band he would not go; and they had no band.
7105_2330_000035_000000 A quarter past ten, half past.
7105_2330_000035_000001 A constant stream of telegraph boys poured in through the prison gates.
7105_2330_000036_000000 "Yamley's factory hands just voted you can guess how," ran a despairing message, and the others were all of the same tenour.
7105_2330_000036_000001 Nemesis was going the way of Reading.
7105_2330_000037_000000 "Have you any band instruments of an easy nature to play?" demanded the Chief Organiser of the Prison Governor; "drums, cymbals, those sort of things?"
7105_2330_000038_000000 "The warders have a private band of their own," said the Governor, "but of course I couldn't allow the men themselves-"
7105_2330_000039_000000 "Lend us the instruments," said the Chief Organiser.
7105_2330_000041_000000 "What tune would you prefer?" he asked Platterbaff.
7105_2330_000042_000000 "The popular song of the moment," replied the Agitator after a moment's reflection.
7105_2330_000043_000000 It was a tune they had all heard hundreds of times, so there was no difficulty in turning out a passable imitation of it.
7105_2330_000044_000000 The seat was lost, after all, by a narrow majority.
7105_2330_000044_000001 The local Trade Unionists took offence at the fact of Cabinet Ministers having personally acted as strike breakers, and even the release of Platterbaff failed to pacify them.
7105_2330_000045_000000 The seat was lost, but Ministers had scored a moral victory.
7105_2340_000002_000000 "I suppose we shall never see Wilfred Pigeoncote here now that he has become heir to the baronetcy and to a lot of money," observed mrs peter Pigeoncote regretfully to her husband.
7105_2340_000003_000000 "Well, we can hardly expect to," he replied, "seeing that we always choked him off from coming to see us when he was a prospective nobody.
7105_2340_000004_000000 "There was a reason for not wanting to encourage his acquaintanceship," said mrs peter.
7105_2340_000004_000001 "With that notorious failing of his he was not the sort of person one wanted in one's house."
7105_2340_000006_000000 "Oh, of course, there is still that drawback," admitted the wife, "but one would like to make the acquaintance of the future head of the family, if only out of mere curiosity.
7105_2340_000006_000001 Besides, cynicism apart, his being rich will make a difference in the way people will look at his failing.
7105_2340_000006_000002 When a man is absolutely wealthy, not merely well to do, all suspicion of sordid motive naturally disappears; the thing becomes merely a tiresome malady."
7105_2340_000007_000001 And the reputation was an unpleasant one.
7105_2340_000007_000003 From his late schooldays onward he had been possessed by an acute and obstinate form of kleptomania; he had the acquisitive instinct of the collector without any of the collector's discrimination.
7105_2340_000007_000006 The search usually produced a large and varied yield.
7105_2340_000008_000002 Signed 'Wilfrid Pigeoncote.' Must be the Snatcher; none of the others have a motor.
7105_2340_000008_000003 I suppose he's bringing us a present for the silver wedding."
7105_2340_000010_000000 "We must keep a sharp look out, that's all," said peter reassuringly.
7105_2340_000012_000001 The talk flitted nervously and hurriedly from one impersonal topic to another.
7105_2340_000012_000003 His hosts, on the other hand, wore an uneasy manner that might have been the hallmark of conscious depravity.
7105_2340_000012_000004 In the drawing room, after dinner, their nervousness and awkwardness increased.
7105_2340_000013_000000 "Oh, we haven't shown you the silver wedding presents," said mrs peter, suddenly, as though struck by a brilliant idea for entertaining the guest; "here they all are.
7105_2340_000013_000002 A few duplicates, of course."
7105_2340_000014_000000 "Seven cream jugs," put in peter.
7105_2340_000015_000001 We feel that we must live on cream for the rest of our lives.
7105_2340_000015_000002 Of course, some of them can be changed."
7105_2340_000016_000000 Wilfrid occupied himself chiefly with such of the gifts as were of antique interest, carrying one or two of them over to the lamp to examine their marks.
7105_2340_000018_000000 "Sorry.
7105_2340_000020_000000 Vigilance was not completely crowned with a sense of victory.
7105_2340_000020_000001 After they had said "Good night" to their visitor, mrs peter expressed her conviction that he had taken something.
7105_2340_000021_000000 "I fancy, by his manner, that there was something up," corroborated her husband; "do you miss anything?"
7105_2340_000024_000000 "How on earth are we to know?" said peter.
7105_2340_000024_000001 "The mean pig hasn't brought us a present, and I'm hanged if he shall carry one off."
7105_2340_000026_000001 mrs peter kept guard outside, while her husband first made a hurried and successful search for the keys, and then plunged at the portmanteau with the air of a disagreeably conscientious Customs official.
7105_2340_000027_000001 Quick, fly down with it and put it back among the others."
7105_2340_000028_000000 Wilfrid was late in coming down to breakfast, and his manner showed plainly that something was amiss.
7105_2340_000029_000001 Something's been taken out of my portmanteau.
7105_2340_000029_000002 It was a little present from my mother and myself for your silver wedding.
7105_2340_000029_000004 I thought I'd get it changed for something else, and now it's gone."
7105_2340_000030_000001 The Snatcher had been an orphan these many years.
7105_2340_000031_000000 "Yes, my mother's at Cairo just now, and she wrote to me at Dresden to try and get you something quaint and pretty in the old silver line, and I pitched on this cream jug."
7105_2340_000032_000000 Both the Pigeoncotes had turned deadly pale.
7105_2340_000032_000001 The mention of Dresden had thrown a sudden light on the situation.
7105_2340_000032_000004 And they had rifled and despoiled his portmanteau!
7105_2340_000032_000005 Husband and wife looked blankly and desperately at one another.
7105_2340_000032_000006 It was mrs peter who arrived first at an inspiration.
7105_2340_000033_000001 We keep the drawing room locked up at night, of course, but anything might be carried off while we are at breakfast."
7105_2340_000035_000000 "There are eight cream jugs now, instead of seven," she cried; "this one wasn't there before.
7105_2340_000035_000001 What a curious trick of memory, mr Wilfrid!
7105_2340_000035_000002 You must have slipped downstairs with it last night and put it there before we locked up, and forgotten all about having done it in the morning."
7105_2340_000036_000001 "Only the other day I went into the town to pay a bill, and went in again next day, having clean forgotten that I'd-"
7105_2340_000037_000001 Some one had taken it while I was away from the room."
7105_2340_000038_000000 The Pigeoncotes had turned paler than ever.
7105_2340_000038_000001 mrs peter had a final inspiration.
7105_2340_000041_000000 mrs peter turned to her guest with confidential coyness.
7105_2340_000042_000000 "A diplomat like you will know how to treat this as if it hadn't happened.
7105_2340_000043_000000 "Good Lord!
7105_2340_000044_000002 The doctors have a special name for it.
7105_2340_000044_000003 He must have pounced on your portmanteau the moment you went to your bath, and taken the first thing he came across.
7105_2340_000045_000000 mrs peter broke off in some confusion, and tripped out to meet her husband in the hall.
7105_2340_000046_000000 "It's all right," she whispered to him; "I've explained everything.
7105_2340_000046_000001 Don't say anything more about it."
7105_2340_000047_000000 "Brave little woman," said peter, with a gasp of relief; "I could never have done it."
7105_2340_000048_000000 Diplomatic reticence does not necessarily extend to family affairs.
7127_75946_000001_000001 The Ballet of the Seasons.
7127_75946_000002_000000 At the conclusion of the banquet, which was served at five o'clock, the king entered his cabinet, where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing Spring, which was the result of so much imagination, and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court.
7127_75946_000002_000001 As for the ballet itself, every person knew the part he had to take in it, and how to perform it.
7127_75946_000002_000002 The king had resolved to make it surprise.
7127_75946_000009_000000 "Why so?"
7127_75946_000012_000000 "Certainly, sire; but I must have money to do that."
7127_75946_000014_000000 "Sire, they were sent at the hour promised."
7127_75946_000015_000000 "Well?"
7127_75946_000016_000000 "Well, sire, the colored lamps, the fireworks, the musicians, and the cooks, have swallowed up four millions in eight days."
7127_75946_000017_000000 "Entirely?"
7127_75946_000018_000000 "To the last penny.
7127_75946_000021_000000 "What do you mean?" inquired Louis.
7127_75946_000022_000001 He has given them with too much grace not to have others still to give, if they are required, which is the case at the present moment.
7127_75946_000022_000002 It is necessary, therefore, that he should comply."
7127_75946_000023_000002 Colbert," said he, accentuating the financier's name, "that is not the way I understood the matter; I do not wish to make use, against any of my servants, of a means of pressure which may oppress him and fetter his services.
7127_75946_000024_000001 "And yet," he said, "your majesty did not use this language some time ago, when the news about Belle Isle arrived, for instance."
7127_75946_000026_000000 "Nothing, however, has changed since then; on the contrary, indeed."
7127_75946_000027_000000 "In my thoughts, monsieur, everything has changed."
7127_75946_000029_000000 "My affairs concern myself alone, monsieur; and I have already told you I transact them without interference."
7127_75946_000030_000000 "Then, I perceive," said Colbert, trembling with anger and fear, "that I have had the misfortune to fall into disgrace with your majesty."
7127_75946_000031_000000 "Not at all; you are, on the contrary, most agreeable to me."
7127_75946_000033_000000 "I reserve your services for a better occasion; and believe me, they will only be the better appreciated."
7127_75946_000036_000000 "Seven hundred thousand francs, sire."
7127_75946_000037_000000 "You will take them from my private treasure." Colbert bowed.
7127_75946_000037_000001 "And," added Louis, "as it seems a difficult matter for you, notwithstanding your economy, to defray, with so limited a sum, the expenses which I intend to incur, I will at once sign an order for three millions."
7127_75946_000039_000001 The news circulated with the rapidity of lightning; during its progress it kindled every variety of coquetry, desire, and wild ambition.
7127_75946_000039_000002 At the same moment, as if by enchantment, every one who knew how to hold a needle, every one who could distinguish a coat from a pair of trousers, was summoned to the assistance of those who had received invitations. The king had completed his toilette by nine o'clock; he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers.
7127_75946_000039_000003 The queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dias or platform, erected upon the borders of the lake, in a theater of wonderful elegance of construction.
7127_75946_000039_000006 By degrees, as the sight became accustomed to so much brilliancy, the rarest beauties appeared to the view, as in the evening sky the stars appear one by one to him who closes his eyes and then opens them again.
7127_75946_000040_000000 The theater represented a grove of trees; a few fauns lifting up their cloven feet were jumping about; a dryad made her appearance on the scene, and was immediately pursued by them; others gathered round her for her defense, and they quarrelled as they danced.
7127_75946_000040_000001 Suddenly, for the purpose of restoring peace and order, Spring, accompanied by his whole court, made his appearance.
7127_75946_000040_000002 The Elements, subaltern powers of mythology, together with their attributes, hastened to follow their gracious sovereign.
7127_75946_000040_000003 The Seasons, allies of Spring, followed him closely, to form a quadrille, which, after many words of more or less flattering import, was the commencement of the dance.
7127_75946_000040_000004 The music, hautboys, flutes, and viols, was delightfully descriptive of rural delights.
7127_75946_000040_000006 He was dressed in a tunic of flowers, which set off his graceful and well formed figure to advantage.
7127_75946_000040_000007 His legs, the best shaped at court, were displayed to great advantage in flesh colored silken hose, of silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself.
7127_75946_000040_000008 The most beautiful pale lilac satin shoes, with bows of flowers and leaves, imprisoned his small feet.
7127_75946_000040_000010 Such was the prince of that period: justly that evening styled "The King of all the Loves." There was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal, and he did not dance so much as seem to soar along.
7127_75946_000040_000011 His entrance produced, therefore, the most brilliant effect.
7127_75946_000041_000001 The applause continued so long that the comte had ample leisure to join the king.
7127_75946_000043_000000 "Nothing whatever," replied the courtier, as pale as death; "but your majesty has not thought of Fruits."
7127_75946_000044_000000 "Yes; it is suppressed."
7127_75946_000045_000000 "Far from it, sire; your majesty having given no directions about it, the musicians have retained it."
7127_75946_000046_000002 It must be suppressed."
7127_75946_000048_000000 "But, come, since-"
7127_75946_000050_000000 "But what?"
7127_75946_000052_000000 "Here?" replied the king, frowning, "here?
7127_75946_000052_000001 Are you sure?"
7127_75946_000053_000000 "Yes, sire; and ready dressed for the ballet."
7127_75946_000054_000000 The king felt himself color deeply, and said, "You are probably mistaken."
7127_75946_000055_000000 "So little is that the case, sire, that if your majesty will look to the right, you will see that the comte is in waiting."
7127_75946_000056_000000 Louis turned hastily towards the side, and in fact, on his right, brilliant in his character of Autumn, De Guiche awaited until the king should look at him, in order that he might address him.
7127_75946_000057_000002 I did not wish to be the substance of so dark a shadow to your majesty's elegance, skill, and graceful invention; and I have left my tenants in order to place my services at your majesty's commands."
7127_75946_000058_000000 Every word fell distinctly, in perfect harmony and eloquence, upon Louis the fourteenth's ears.
7127_75946_000058_000001 Their flattery pleased, as much as De Guiche's courage had astonished him, and he simply replied: "I did not tell you to return, comte."
7127_75946_000059_000000 "Certainly not, sire; but your majesty did not tell me to remain."
7127_75946_000060_000001 Besides, the king's heart was filled with two or three new ideas; he had just derived fresh inspiration from the eloquent glances of Madame.
7127_75946_000060_000002 Her look had said to him: "Since they are jealous of you, divide their suspicions, for the man who distrusts two rivals does not object to either in particular." So that Madame, by this clever diversion, decided him.
7127_75946_000060_000003 The king smiled upon De Guiche, who did not comprehend a word of Madame's dumb language, but he remarked that she pretended not to look at him, and he attributed the pardon which had been conferred upon him to the princess's kindness of heart.
7127_75946_000060_000004 The king seemed only pleased with every one present.
7127_75946_000060_000005 Monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter.
7127_75946_000060_000006 The ballet began; the effect was more than beautiful.
7127_75946_000060_000007 When the music, by its bursts of melody, carried away these illustrious dancers, when the simple, untutored pantomime of that period, only the more natural on account of the very indifferent acting of the august actors, had reached its culminating point of triumph, the theater shook with tumultuous applause.
7127_75946_000061_000001 Disdainful of a success of which Madame showed no acknowledgement, he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the marked preference of the princess.
7127_75946_000061_000002 She, however, did not bestow a single glance upon him.
7127_75946_000061_000004 The king, who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadrille, cast a look upon his vanquished rival.
7127_75946_000061_000005 De Guiche soon ceased to sustain even the character of the courtier; without applause, he danced indifferently, and very soon could not dance at all, by which accident the triumph of the king and of Madame was assured.
7127_75947_000006_000000 The king remained for a moment to enjoy a triumph as complete as it could possibly be.
7127_75947_000006_000001 He then turned towards Madame, for the purpose of admiring her also a little in her turn.
7127_75947_000006_000004 The victim, however, of all these royal affections and affectations, was poor De Guiche. Every one could observe his agitation and prostration-a prostration which was, indeed, the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side, his head bewildered, and his eyes with all their bright intelligence bedimmed.
7127_75947_000006_000005 It rarely happened that any uneasiness was excited on his account, whenever a question of elegance or taste was under discussion; and De Guiche's defeat was accordingly attributed by the greater number present to his courtier like tact and ability.
7127_75947_000006_000007 All these sufferings, successes, and remarks were blended, confounded, and lost in the uproar of applause.
7127_75947_000006_000009 De Guiche, observing that she was alone, near a thicket constructed of painted cloth, approached her.
7127_75947_000006_000011 A cold shiver passed through poor De Guiche; he was unprepared for such utter indifference, for he had neither seen nor been told of anything that had taken place, and consequently could guess nothing.
7127_75947_000006_000012 Remarking, therefore, that his obeisance obtained him no acknowledgement, he advanced one step further, and in a voice which he tried, though vainly, to render calm, said: "I have the honor to present my most humble respects to your royal highness."
7127_75947_000007_000000 Upon this Madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte, observing.
7127_75947_000007_000002 good day!"
7127_75947_000009_000000 "Do you think so?" she replied with indifference.
7127_75947_000010_000000 "Yes; the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own."
7127_75947_000012_000000 "Oh! there can be no doubt of it."
7127_75947_000013_000000 "Explain yourself?"
7127_75947_000014_000000 "You represented a divinity, beautiful, disdainful, inconstant."
7127_75947_000015_000000 "You mean Pomona, comte?"
7127_75947_000016_000000 "I allude to the goddess."
7127_75947_000019_000000 With this remark, accompanied by one of those deep sighs which affect the remotest fibers of one's being, his heart burdened with sorrow and throbbing fast, his head on fire, and his gaze wandering, he bowed breathlessly, and withdrew behind the thicket.
7127_75947_000019_000001 The only reply Madame condescended to make was by slightly raising her shoulders, and, as her ladies of honor had discreetly retired while the conversation lasted, she recalled them by a look.
7127_75947_000021_000000 "no"
7127_75947_000023_000000 She then rose, humming the air to which she was presently going to dance.
7127_75947_000023_000001 De Guiche had overheard everything.
7127_75947_000023_000002 The arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally.
7127_75947_000023_000004 A quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theater; but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back; or perhaps, for love is thus strangely constituted, he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated from the presence of one who had broken his heart.
7127_75947_000023_000006 She saw, but did not look at De Guiche, who, irritated and revengeful, turned his back upon her as she passed him, escorted by her nymphs, and followed by a hundred flatterers.
7127_75947_000023_000007 During this time, at the other end of the theater, near the lake, a young woman was seated, with her eyes fixed upon one of the windows of the theater, from which were issuing streams of light-the window in question being that of the royal box.
7127_75947_000023_000008 As De Guiche quitted the theater for the purpose of getting into the fresh air he so much needed, he passed close to this figure and saluted her.
7127_75947_000023_000009 When she perceived the young man, she rose, like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself.
7127_75947_000025_000000 "Pray do not leave me," said De Guiche, stretching out his hand towards her, "for you would be contradicting the kind words you have just pronounced.
7127_75947_000025_000001 Remain, I implore you: the evening is most lovely.
7127_75947_000025_000002 You wish to escape from the merry tumult, and prefer your own society.
7127_75947_000025_000003 Well, I can understand it; all women who are possessed of any feeling do, and one never finds them dull or lonely when removed from the giddy vortex of these exciting amusements.
7127_75947_000025_000004 Oh!
7127_75947_000025_000005 Heaven!" he exclaimed, suddenly.
7127_75947_000026_000001 "You seem agitated."
7127_75947_000027_000000 "I! oh, no!"
7127_75947_000028_000001 It is to your recommendation, I am aware, that I owe my admission among the number of Madame's maids of honor."
7127_75947_000029_000000 "Indeed!
7127_75947_000029_000001 Ah!
7127_75947_000029_000002 I remember now, and I congratulate myself.
7127_75947_000029_000003 Do you love any one?"
7127_75947_000031_000000 "Forgive me, I hardly know what I am saying; a thousand times forgive me; Madame was right, quite right, this brutal exile has completely turned my brain."
7127_75947_000032_000000 "And yet it seemed to me that the king received you with kindness."
7127_75947_000033_000000 "Do you think so?
7127_75947_000033_000001 Received me with kindness-perhaps so-yes-"
7127_75947_000034_000000 "There cannot be a doubt he received you kindly, for, in fact, you returned without his permission."
7127_75947_000035_000000 "Quite true, and I believe you are right.
7127_75947_000036_000001 "Why do you ask?" she inquired.
7127_75947_000037_000000 "Have I offended you again?" said De Guiche.
7127_75947_000037_000001 "In that case I am indeed unhappy, and greatly to be pitied."
7127_75947_000038_000000 "Yes, very unhappy, and very much to be pitied, Monsieur de Guiche, for you seem to be suffering terribly."
7127_75947_000039_000000 "Oh! mademoiselle, why have I not a devoted sister, or a true friend, such as yourself?"
7127_75947_000041_000002 His dark shadow glided, lengthening as it disappeared, among the illumined yews and glittering undulations of the water.
7127_75947_000043_000000 "What, already here!" they said to her.
7127_75947_000043_000001 "We thought we should be first at the rendezvous."
7127_75947_000047_000000 "But surely the enchanting spectacle?"
7127_75947_000048_000000 "No more than the dancing.
7127_75947_000050_000000 "In other words," said Montalais, "she is insupportable.
7127_75947_000051_000001 "I am a woman; and there are few like me; whoever loves me, flatters me; whoever flatters me, pleases me; and whoever pleases-"
7127_75947_000052_000000 "Well!" said Montalais, "you do not finish."
7127_75947_000053_000001 "Do you, who are so clever, finish for me."
7127_75947_000054_000000 "And you, Louise?" said Montalais, "does any one please you?"
7127_75947_000055_000002 We are three in number, we like one another, and the night is lovely.
7127_75947_000055_000003 Look yonder, do you not see the moon slowly rising, silvering the topmost branches of the chestnuts and the oaks.
7127_75947_000055_000005 Out yonder all are at this moment seated at table and fully occupied, or preparing to adorn themselves for a set and formal promenade; horses are being saddled, or harnessed to the carriages-the queen's mules or Madame's four white ponies.
7127_75947_000055_000006 As for ourselves, we shall soon reach some retired spot where no eyes can see us and no step follow ours.
7127_75947_000056_000000 "And confidences too?"
7127_75947_000057_000000 "Yes."
7127_75947_000061_000000 "Quick, quick, then, among the high reed grass," said Montalais; "stoop, Athenais, you are so tall."
7127_75947_000062_000001 The young girls had, indeed, made themselves small-indeed invisible.
7127_75947_000065_000000 The two young men approached still closer, conversing in animated tones. "She was here just now," said the count.
7127_75947_000065_000001 "If I had only seen her, I should have declared it to be a vision, but I spoke to her."
7127_75947_000066_000000 "You are positive, then?"
7127_75947_000067_000000 "Yes; but perhaps I frightened her."
7127_75947_000068_000000 "In what way?"
7127_75947_000069_000000 "Oh!
7127_75947_000069_000001 I was still half crazy at you know what; so that she could hardly have understood what I was saying, and must have grown alarmed."
7127_75947_000071_000000 "Yes, but if she should have understood, and understood too well, she may talk."
7127_75947_000072_000000 "You do not know Louise, count," said Raoul.
7127_75947_000072_000001 "Louise possesses every virtue, and has not a single fault." And the two young men passed on, and, as they proceeded, their voices were soon lost in the distance.
7127_75947_000075_000000 "Well?"
7127_75947_000076_000000 "It seems the king will not consent to it."
7127_75947_000077_000002 "Good gracious! has the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind?
7127_75947_000078_000000 Athenais began to laugh.
7127_75947_000079_000000 "Oh!
7127_75947_000079_000001 I am speaking seriously," replied Montalais, "and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the king's, I suppose; is it not, Louise?"
7127_75947_000080_000000 "Come," said La Valliere, "these gentlemen have passed; let us take advantage of our being alone to cross the open ground and so take refuge in the woods."
7127_75947_000081_000000 "So much the better," said Athenais, "because I see the torches setting out from the chateau and the theater, and they seem as if they were preceding some person of distinction."
7127_75947_000082_000002 Montalais agile as a deer, Athenais eager as a young wolf, bounded through the dry grass, and, now and then, some bold Acteon might, by the aid of the faint light, have perceived their straight and well formed limbs somewhat displayed beneath the heavy folds of their satin petticoats.
7127_75947_000082_000004 At this moment, a man, concealed in a dry ditch planted with young willow saplings, scrambled quickly up its shelving side, and ran off in the direction of the chateau.
7127_75947_000082_000005 The three young girls, on their side, reached the outskirts of the park, every path of which they well knew.
7127_75947_000082_000006 The ditches were bordered by high hedges full of flowers, which on that side protected the foot passengers from being intruded upon by the horses and carriages.
7127_75947_000082_000008 Near the songster, in the dark background of the large trees, could be seen the glistening eyes of an owl, attracted by the harmony.
7127_75947_000082_000012 Beneath this oak the gardeners had piled up the moss and turf in such a manner that never had a seat more luxuriously rested the wearied limbs of man or monarch.
7176_88083_000001_000000 The Fisher in the Chutes
7176_88083_000002_000000 He was plainly a duck.
7176_88083_000002_000003 He was too imposing in appearance, too gorgeous in apparel, too bold and vigilant in demeanor to be so misunderstood.
7176_88083_000002_000004 Moreover, he was not in the situation or the surroundings which one is wont to associate with ducks.
7176_88083_000003_000000 In fact, after the fashion of a cormorant or a kingfisher, he was perched motionless on a big dead stub of a branch.
7176_88083_000003_000001 This branch was thrust out very obligingly in just the place where this most singular of ducks would have desired it if it had been consulted in the matter.
7176_88083_000003_000002 It directly overhung a transparent amber brown chute of unbroken water in the midst of the loud turmoil of North Fork Rapids.
7176_88083_000004_000000 The duck was a handsome male of the red breasted merganser family, and the absorbing interest of his life was fish.
7176_88083_000004_000001 It was not in the quiet pools and long, deep reaches of dark water that he loved to seek his prey, but rather to snatch it from the grasp of the loud chutes and the roaring rips.
7176_88083_000004_000002 Here, where the North Fork stream fell into the Ottanoonsis, was a resort exactly to his liking.
7176_88083_000004_000003 And most of the fish-trout, salmon, grilse or parr-which journeyed up and down either the Fork or the parent river chose to pass through that sluice of swift but unbroken flow immediately beneath the overhanging branch on which he perched.
7176_88083_000005_000000 For all the splendor of his plumage, the merganser was not conspicuous where he sat
7176_88083_000005_000002 The rapids were foam white, or golden ruddy, or deep, shining green brown under the sharp and patchy sunlight, and they were sown thickly with wet black rocks, here and there glinting with purple.
7176_88083_000005_000003 The merganser had a crested head of iridescent green black, a broad collar of lustrous white, black back, black and white wings, white belly, sides finely pencilled in black and white, and a breast of rich chestnut red, streaked with black.
7176_88083_000005_000004 His feet were red, his long narrow beak, with its saw toothed edges and sharp hooked tip, was bright red.
7176_88083_000005_000005 In every line and hue he was unmistakably an aristocrat among ducks, and an arrogant one at that.
7176_88083_000006_000002 His beak, with its keen toothed edges, was a formidable weapon, by means of which he could doubtless have captured, disabled, and dragged to shore even a fish of a pound or so in weight.
7176_88083_000006_000003 But here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls, hawks, and eagles.
7176_88083_000006_000004 He had no rending claws.
7176_88083_000006_000005 Had he taken such a prize, he could not have profited by it, having no means of tearing it to pieces.
7176_88083_000007_000000 But suddenly, straight and swift as a diving cormorant, he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface.
7176_88083_000007_000001 A watcher directly overhead, escaping the baffling reflections, might have seen him swimming, head outstretched, mastering the tremendous rush of the stream with mighty strokes, fairly out speeding the fish in their own element. Near the limit of the clear water he overtook and seized the quarry which he had marked-a trout not far from seven inches in length.
7176_88083_000008_000002 Here he proceeded to swallow his prize head first.
7176_88083_000009_000000 Just about this time, in the clear blue overhead, a green winged teal was beating his way above the treetops, making for the stream with the fear of death at his heart.
7176_88083_000009_000002 But behind him, overtaking him inexorably, came the shape that stood for doom itself in the eyes of all his tribe-the dreadful blue falcon, or duck hawk.
7176_88083_000010_000000 The teal's wings, throbbing with a swift, short vibration, whistled shrilly in the still air, so that a prowling wildcat by the waterside heard the sound even above the dull roar of the rapids, and glared upward alertly.
7176_88083_000010_000002 For all its appalling speed, the sound of his flight was nothing more than a strong pulsating hiss.
7176_88083_000011_000000 Close ahead of him now the teal saw refuge-the flashing line of the rapids.
7176_88083_000011_000001 But the hawk was already close upon him.
7176_88083_000011_000002 In despair he hurled himself downward too soon.
7176_88083_000011_000005 It was enough, however, and the unhappy teal was hurled earthward, flapping through the tips of the branches.
7176_88083_000011_000006 The great hawk followed hurriedly, to retrieve his prey from the ground.
7176_88083_000012_000000 As it chanced, however, the victim came down with a thud almost beneath the whiskered nose of the wildcat.
7176_88083_000012_000001 A pounce, and the great cat had her paw upon it, and crouched snarling up at the hawk.
7176_88083_000012_000003 But wisdom came to him just in time, and he did not strike home.
7176_88083_000012_000004 His swoop became a demonstration merely, an expression of his rage at having his prey thus snatched from his beak. With one short, shrill cry of anger, he swerved off and sailed upward over the river.
7176_88083_000012_000005 The cat growled softly, picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it.
7176_88083_000013_000000 The spot where all this happened was perhaps a hundred yards below that dead tree upon whose outthrust naked branch the splendid merganser drake was making his meal.
7176_88083_000013_000001 In fact, he had just finished it-the last of the trout's tail had just vanished with a spasm down his strained gullet-when the baffled hawk caught sight of him and swooped.
7176_88083_000013_000002 Happily for him, he on his part caught sight of the hawk, and dropped like lead into the torrent.
7176_88083_000013_000003 The hawk alighted on the dead branch, and sat upright, motionless, as if surprised.
7176_88083_000014_000000 The fisher of the chutes, meanwhile, was swimming straight downstream for the broken water.
7176_88083_000014_000001 Like his unfortunate little cousin, the teal, he, too, had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart, and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank, deep fringed with weeds, where the dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him.
7176_88083_000015_000000 The hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface.
7176_88083_000015_000002 Almost instantly he was forced to the top.
7176_88083_000015_000003 With only head and wings above the mad smother, he flapped onward frantically, beating down the foam about him.
7176_88083_000015_000004 Straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.
7176_88083_000016_000000 The drake sank again instantly.
7176_88083_000016_000002 As long as his body was completely submerged, it was at the mercy of the twisting and tortured currents, which rolled him over and over, in spite of his swimming craft.
7176_88083_000016_000003 He would have been drowned, the breath battered clean out of him, in half a minute more, had he maintained the hopelessly unequal struggle.
7176_88083_000016_000004 Once more he half emerged, filled his gasping lungs, and pounded onward desperately, half flying and half swimming.
7176_88083_000016_000005 It was a mongrel method of progression, in which he was singularly expert.
7176_88083_000017_000000 Immediately over his outstretched gleaming head flew the hawk.
7176_88083_000017_000005 Where the waves for an instant sank, they came closer,--but not quite within grasping reach.
7176_88083_000017_000006 The marauder from the upper air was waiting till his quarry should reach less turbulent waters.
7176_88083_000018_000000 A few yards further on, the torrent fell seething over a long ledge into a pool of brief quiet.
7176_88083_000018_000001 Immediately beyond the lip of the ledge the hawk lifted his wings high over his back and struck downward, so that his talons went deep into the water.
7176_88083_000018_000002 But water was all they clutched.
7176_88083_000018_000003 The wily drake had plunged with the plunge of the fall itself, and was now darting onward at a safe depth.
7176_88083_000018_000004 The hawk followed, his wing tips now almost brushing the water.
7176_88083_000018_000005 The pool was, perhaps, a hundred yards in length.
7176_88083_000018_000007 But, as before, the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer, and he was able to flap his way onward in a cloud of foam, while doom hung low above his head, yet hesitated to strike.
7176_88083_000019_000000 The odds, however, were now laid heavily against the fugitive.
7176_88083_000019_000001 The hawk, embittered by the loss of his first quarry, had become as dogged in pursuit as a weasel, not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived.
7176_88083_000019_000002 The rapids would presently come to an end.
7176_88083_000019_000003 Then, in the still water, unless he should chance upon a hiding place, the drake would soon be forced to come to the top for breath, and those throttling talons would instantly close upon his neck.
7176_88083_000019_000004 But the antic forest Fates, wearied of the simple routine of the wilderness, had decreed an altogether novel intervention, and were giggling in their cloaks of ancient moss.
7176_88083_000020_000001 He had three flies on his cast, and, because in these waters there was always the chance of hooking a grilse, he was using heavy tackle.
7176_88083_000020_000002 His flies, as befitted these amber brown, tumultuous northern streams, were large and conspicuous-a Parmacheenie Belle for the tail fly, with a Montreal and a Red Hackle for the drops.
7176_88083_000022_000000 Just as he made his cast, he saw the fleeing drake and the pursuing hawk come round the bend.
7176_88083_000022_000001 He saw the frantic fugitive dive over the ledge and disappear.
7176_88083_000022_000002 He saw the great hawk swoop savagely.
7176_88083_000022_000003 He tried to check his cast, but it was too late.
7176_88083_000023_000000 The last drop fly, as luck would have it, caught just in the corner of the hawk's angrily open beak, hooking itself firmly.
7176_88083_000023_000001 At the sudden sharp sting of it, the great bird turned his head and noticed, for the first time, the fisherman standing on the bank.
7176_88083_000023_000002 At the same moment he felt the light restraint of the almost invisible leader upon his wings, where the other two flies had affixed themselves.
7176_88083_000023_000004 The drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him, and appalling.
7176_88083_000023_000006 For a moment the fisherman, bewildered, tried to play him like a salmon.
7176_88083_000023_000007 Then the leader parted from the line.
7176_88083_000023_000008 The fisherman reeled in the limp coils, and the worried hawk flew off with the flies.
7176_88083_000024_000000 The drake, unrealizing that the dreadful chase was done, sped onward beneath the surface till he could go without breath no longer.
7176_88083_000024_000001 Then he came up among some arrowweeds, lifted his head beneath the shelter of one of the broad barbed leaves, and floated there quivering.
7176_88083_000024_000002 For a good ten minutes he waited, moveless, with the patience of the wild things. Then his terror faded, appetite once more began to invite his attention, and he took note of a minnow flickering slowly over the sun flecked mud below him.
7176_88083_000024_000003 He dived and caught it, came to the surface and swallowed it. Much refreshed, he looked about him.
7176_88083_000024_000004 There was no such thing as a hawk in sight.
7176_88083_000024_000006 The drake was suspicious of men, though he did not greatly fear them, as he and his rank fleshed tribe were not interesting to the hunters.
7176_88083_000024_000007 He rose noisily into the air, made a detour over the tree tops to avoid the fisherman, and flew back to his dead branch overhanging the amber rush of the chutes.
7176_92135_000002_000000 THE COMPLETE DRAMATIST
7176_92135_000003_000002 The successful playwright is indeed a man to be envied. Leaving aside for the moment the question of super tax, the prizes which fall to his lot are worth something of an effort.
7176_92135_000003_000004 In short he becomes a "prominent figure in London Society"--and, if he is not careful, somebody will say so.
7176_92135_000004_000000 But even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments.
7176_92135_000004_000002 It was an unsatisfying life; and when rash acquaintances asked him what he did, he used to say that he was for the Bar.
7176_92135_000005_000002 How shall this success be achieved?
7176_92135_000006_000000 Frankly I cannot always say.
7176_92135_000006_000002 How shall I do it?"--well, I couldn't help you.
7176_92135_000006_000003 But suppose you said, "I'm fond of writing; my people always say my letters home are good enough for 'Punch.' I've got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman, and-but perhaps I'd better keep the plot a secret for the moment.
7176_92135_000006_000005 The only thing is, I don't know anything about technique and stagecraft and the three unities and that sort of rot.
7176_92135_000006_000006 Can you give me a few hints?"--suppose you spoke to me like this, then I could do something for you.
7176_92135_000006_000007 "My dear Sir," I should reply (or Madam), "you have come to the right shop.
7176_92135_000006_000008 Lend me your ear for ten minutes, and you shall learn just what stagecraft is." And I should begin with a short homily on
7176_92135_000007_000000 SOLILOQUY
7176_92135_000008_000000 If you ever read your "Shakespeare"--and no dramatist should despise the works of another dramatist; he may always pick up something in them which may be useful for his next play-if you ever read your "Shakespeare," it is possible that you have come across this passage:
7176_92135_000011_000000 And, so on in the same vein for some thirty lines.
7176_92135_000012_000000 These few remarks are called a soliloquy, being addressed rather to the world in general than to any particular person on the stage.
7176_92135_000012_000001 Now the object of this soliloquy is plain.
7176_92135_000012_000003 Of course, a really good actor can often give a clue to the feelings of a character simply by facial expression.
7176_92135_000012_000004 There are ways of shifting the eyebrows, distending the nostrils, and exploring the lower molars with the tongue by which it is possible to denote respectively Surprise, Defiance and Doubt.
7176_92135_000013_000000 So the soliloquy came into being.
7176_92135_000014_000000 What, then, is to be done?
7176_92135_000015_000000 Well, there are more ways than one; and now we come to what is meant by stagecraft.
7176_92135_000015_000001 Stagecraft is the art of getting over these and other difficulties, and (if possible) getting over them in a showy manner, so that people will say, "How remarkable his stagecraft is for so young a writer," when otherwise they mightn't have noticed it at all.
7176_92135_000018_000000 And so on, till you get to the end, when Ophelia might say, "Ah, yes," or something non committal of that sort.
7176_92135_000018_000001 This would be an easy way of doing it, but it would not be the best way, for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself.
7176_92135_000018_000002 What you want is to make it clear that you are conveying Hamlet's thoughts to the audience in rather a clever manner.
7176_92135_000019_000003 Could anything be more natural?
7176_92135_000020_000000 Let us, to give an example of how this method works, go back again to the play we have been discussing.
7176_92135_000022_000008 Hamlet speaking.
7176_92135_000022_000010 To be or not to be, that is the question; whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows-What? No, Hamlet speaking.
7176_92135_000022_000013 I want double nine two three-sorry....
7176_92135_000022_000014 Is that you, Exchange?
7176_92135_000022_000020 No, "be"--b e.
7176_92135_000022_000021 Yes, that's right.
7176_92135_000022_000022 To be or not to be, that is the question; whether 'tis nobler-
7176_92135_000023_000001 You see how effective it is.
7176_92135_000024_000001 It is to let Hamlet, if that happen to be the name of your character, enter with a small dog, pet falcon, mongoose, tame bear or whatever animal is most in keeping with the part, and confide in this animal such sorrows, hopes or secret history as the audience has got to know.
7176_92135_000028_000000 And so on.
7176_92135_000028_000001 Which strikes me as rather sweet and natural.
7176_92135_000030_000000 EXITS AND ENTRANCES
7176_92135_000031_000003 Why did Lord Arthur Fluffinose enter?
7176_92135_000031_000004 The obvious answer, that the firm which is mentioned in the programme as supplying his trousers would be annoyed if he didn't, is not enough; nor is it enough to say that the whole plot of the piece hinges on him, and that without him the drama would languish.
7176_92135_000031_000006 Was it only a coincidence?
7176_92135_000032_000001 If that be so, he must explain it.
7176_92135_000034_000001 Arthur!
7176_92135_000035_000001 You will see this for yourself if you consider the passage as it should properly have been written:--
7176_92135_000039_000001 Larkspur!
7176_92135_000040_000001 What is it?
7176_92135_000045_000002 Whatever-
7176_92135_000053_000001 You will, of course, appreciate that the unfinished sentences not only save time, but also make the manoeuvring very much more natural.
7176_92135_000055_000000 The answer to this will depend upon the length of the play, for upon the length depends the hour at which the curtain rises.
7176_92135_000056_000002 Then the curtain rises, and it is apparent that we are assisting at an At Home of considerable splendour.
7176_92135_000056_000003 Most of the characters seem to be on the stage, and for once we do not ask how they got there.
7176_92135_000058_000001 Charming.
7176_92135_000058_000002 Quite one of my favourites.
7176_92135_000058_000003 Do play it again.
7176_92135_000067_000001 You will never be a dramatist until you have learnt the technique of
7176_92135_000068_000000 MEALS
7176_92135_000069_000001 Then is the time to introduce a meal on the stage.
7176_92135_000069_000002 A stage meal is popular, because it proves to the audience that the actors, even when called Charles Hawtrey or Owen Nares, are real people just like you and me.
7176_92135_000070_000002 Let your actors have tea by all means, but see that it is a properly histrionic tea.
7176_92135_000070_000003 This is how it should go:--
7176_92135_000071_000001 How do you do?
7176_92135_000072_000001 Thank you.
7176_92135_000074_000001 Tea, please, Matthews.
7176_92135_000075_000001 Yes, m'lady.
7176_92135_000076_000001 Sugar?
7176_92135_000077_000001 No, thanks.
7176_92135_000081_000001 Good bye; so glad you could come.
7176_92135_000083_000000 Tea is the most usual meal on the stage, for the reason that it is the least expensive, the property lump of sugar being dusted and used again on the next night.
7176_92135_000083_000003 The etiquette is to have two bites before the butler and the three footmen whisk away the plate.
7176_92135_000083_000005 Besides, the thing is coming back again as chicken directly.
7176_92135_000084_000000 But it is the cigarette which chiefly has brought the modern drama to its present state of perfection.
7176_92135_000084_000001 Without the stage cigarette many an epigram would pass unnoticed, many an actor's hands would be much more noticeable; and the man who works the fireproof safety curtain would lose even the small amount of excitement which at present attaches to his job.
7176_92135_000085_000000 Now although it is possible, in the case of a few men at the top of the profession, to leave the conduct of the cigarette entirely to the actor, you will find it much more satisfactory to insert in the stage directions the particular movements (with match and so forth) that you wish carried out.
7176_92135_000085_000001 Let us assume that Lord Arthur asks Lord john what a cynic is-the question of what a cynic is having arisen quite naturally in the course of the plot.
7176_92135_000085_000002 Let us assume further that you wish Lord john to reply, "A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing."
7176_92135_000085_000003 It has been said before, but you may feel that it is quite time it was said again; besides, for all the audience knows, Lord john may simply be quoting.
7176_92135_000085_000004 Now this answer, even if it comes quite fresh to the stalls, will lose much of its effect if it is said without the assistance of a cigarette.
7176_92135_000086_000001 A cynic is a man who, etc...
7176_92135_000089_000001 Once more:---
7176_92135_000090_000001 A cynic is a man who, etc
7176_92135_000092_000000 Well, I see I must tell you.
7176_92135_000094_000000 It makes a different thing of it altogether.
7729_102255_000001_000000 CIVIL WAR IN KANSAS
7729_102255_000002_000001 The bogus Legislature numbered thirty six members.
7729_102255_000002_000003 This was at the March election, eighteen fifty five.
7729_102255_000002_000005 That summer's emigration, however, being mainly from the free States, greatly changed the relative strength of the two parties.
7729_102255_000002_000008 For general service, therefore, requiring no special effort, the numerical strength of the factions was about equal; while on extraordinary occasions the two thousand Border Ruffian reserve lying a little farther back from the State line could at any time easily turn the scale.
7729_102255_000002_000009 The free State men had only their convictions, their intelligence, their courage, and the moral support of the North; the conspiracy had its secret combination, the territorial officials, the Legislature, the bogus laws, the courts, the militia officers, the President, and the army.
7729_102255_000002_000010 This was a formidable array of advantages; slavery was playing with loaded dice.
7729_102255_000003_000000 With such a radical opposition of sentiment, both factions were on the alert to seize every available vantage ground.
7729_102255_000003_000001 The bogus laws having been enacted, and the free State men having, at the Big Springs Convention, resolved on the failure of peaceable remedies to resist them to a "bloody issue," the conspiracy was not slow to cover itself and its projects with the sacred mantle of authority.
7729_102255_000003_000002 Opportunely for them, about this time Governor Shannon, appointed to succeed Reeder, arrived in the Territory.
7729_102255_000003_000003 Coming by way of the Missouri River towns, he fell first among Border Ruffian companionship and influences; and perhaps having his inclinations already molded by his Washington instructions, his early impressions were decidedly adverse to the free State cause.
7729_102255_000003_000004 His reception speech at Westport, in which he maintained the legality of the Legislature, and his determination to enforce their laws, delighted his pro slavery auditors.
7729_102255_000003_000006 All the territorial dignitaries were present; Governor Shannon presided; john Calhoun, the Surveyor General, made the principal speech, a denunciation of the "abolitionists" supporting the Topeka movement; Chief Justice Lecompte dignified the occasion with approving remarks.
7729_102255_000004_000000 Faithful to their legislative declaration they knew but one issue, slavery.
7729_102255_000004_000001 All dissent, all non compliance, all hesitation, all mere silence even, were in their stronghold towns, like Leavenworth, branded as "abolitionism," declared to be hostility to the public welfare, and punished with proscription, personal violence, expulsion, and frequently death.
7729_102255_000004_000002 Of the lynchings, the mobs, and the murders, it would be impossible, except in a very extended work, to note the frequent and atrocious details.
7729_102255_000005_000000 Among other instrumentalities for executing the bogus laws, the bogus Legislature had appointed one Samuel j Jones sheriff of Douglas county kansas Territory, although that individual was at the time of his appointment, and long afterwards, United States postmaster of the town of Westport, Missouri.
7729_102255_000007_000001 The murderer, a pro slavery man, first fled, to Missouri, but returned to Shawnee Mission and sought the official protection of Sheriff Jones; no warrant, no examination, no commitment followed, and the criminal remained at large.
7729_102255_000007_000002 Out of this incident, the officious sheriff managed most ingeniously to create an embroilment with the town of Lawrence, Buckley, who was alleged to have been accessory to the crime, obtained a peace warrant against Branson, a neighbor of the victim.
7729_102255_000007_000003 With this peace warrant in his pocket, but without showing or reading it to his prisoner, Sheriff Jones and a posse of twenty five Border Ruffians proceeded to Branson's house at midnight and arrested him.
7729_102255_000007_000004 Alarm being given, Branson's free State neighbors, already exasperated at the murder, rose under the sudden instinct of self protection and rescued Branson from the sheriff and his posse that same night, though without other violence than harsh words.
7729_102255_000010_000000 Burning with the thirst of personal revenge, Sheriff Jones now accused the town of Lawrence of the violation of law involved in this rescue, though the people of Lawrence immediately and earnestly disavowed the act.
7729_102255_000010_000002 A Border Ruffian foray against the town was hastily organized.
7729_102255_000010_000006 To these an urgent appeal for help was made; and the leaders of the conspiracy in prompt obedience placarded the frontier with inflammatory handbills, and collected and equipped companies, and hurried them forward to the rendezvous without a moment's delay.
7729_102255_000010_000007 The United States Arsenal at Liberty, Missouri, was broken into and stripped of its contents to supply cannon, small arms, and ammunition.
7729_102255_000010_000014 They were not only well armed and supplied, but wrought up to the highest pitch of partisan excitement.
7729_102255_000010_000015 While the Governor's proclamation spoke of serving writs, the notices of the conspirators sounded the note of the real contest.
7729_102255_000010_000016 "Now is the time to show game, and if we are defeated this time, the Territory is lost to the South," said the leaders.
7729_102255_000010_000017 There was no doubt of the earnestness of their purpose.
7729_102255_000011_000001 Two abortive imitations of the Missouri Blue Lodges, set on foot during the summer by the free State men, provoked by the election invasion in March, furnished them a starting point for military organization.
7729_102255_000011_000003 The Free State Hotel served as barracks.
7729_102255_000011_000004 Governor Robinson and Colonel Lane were appointed to command.
7729_102255_000012_000001 The people of Lawrence, without any great difficulty, obtained daily information concerning the hostile camps.
7729_102255_000012_000002 They, on the other hand, professing no purpose but that of defense and self protection, were obliged to permit free and constant ingress to their beleaguered town.
7729_102255_000012_000003 Sheriff Jones made several visits unmolested on their part, and without any display of writs or demand for the surrender of alleged offenders on his own.
7729_102255_000012_000006 They could see that a conflict meant serious results.
7729_102255_000012_000007 With the advantage of its defensive position, Lawrence was as strong as the sheriff's mob.
7729_102255_000012_000008 On one point especially the Border Ruffians had a wholesome dread.
7729_102255_000012_000009 Yankee ingenuity had invented a new kind of breech loading gun called "Sharps rifle." It was, in fact, the best weapon of its day.
7729_102255_000012_000011 The Missouri backwoods men manifested an almost incredible interest in this wonderful gun.
7729_102255_000012_000012 They might be deaf to the "equalities" proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence or blind to the moral sin of slavery, but they comprehended a rifle which could be fired ten times a minute and kill a man at a thousand yards.
7729_102255_000013_000001 The irregular Border Ruffian squads were hastily incorporated into the skeleton "Kansas militia." The "posse" became some two thousand strong, and the defenders of Lawrence perhaps one thousand.
7729_102255_000016_000000 Meanwhile a sober second thought had come to Governor Shannon.
7729_102255_000016_000002 The firm defensive attitude of the people of Lawrence had produced its effect.
7729_102255_000016_000003 The leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town.
7729_102255_000016_000004 One of his militia generals suggested that the Governor should require the "outlaws at Lawrence and elsewhere" to surrender the Sharps rifles; another wrote asking him to call out the Government troops at Fort Leavenworth.
7729_102255_000016_000005 The Governor, on his part, becoming doubtful of the legality of employing Missouri militia to enforce Kansas laws, was also eager to secure the help of Federal troops. Sheriff Jones began to grow importunate.
7729_102255_000016_000006 In the Missouri camp while the leaders became alarmed the men grew insubordinate.
7729_102255_000016_000007 "I have reason to believe," wrote one of their prominent men, "that before to morrow morning the black flag will be hoisted, when nine out of ten will rally round it, and march without orders upon Lawrence.
7729_102255_000016_000008 The forces of the Lecompton camp fully understand the plot and will fight under the same banner."
7729_102255_000018_000002 He hastened to Lawrence, which now invoked his protection.
7729_102255_000018_000003 He directed his militia generals to repress disorder and check any attack on the town. Interviews were held with the free State commanders, and the situation was fully discussed.
7729_102255_000018_000006 Neither party was willing to yield honestly nor ready to fight manfully.
7729_102255_000018_000007 The free State men shrank from forcible resistance to even bogus laws.
7729_102255_000018_000008 The Missouri cabal, on the other hand, having three of their best men constantly at the Governor's side, were compelled to recognize their lack of justification.
7729_102255_000018_000010 They consented to a compromise "to cover a retreat."
7729_102255_000020_000002 There were similar murmurs in the pro slavery camps.
7729_102255_000020_000003 The Governor was denounced as a traitor, and Sheriff Jones declared that "he would have wiped out Lawrence." Atchison, on the contrary, sustained the bargain, explaining that to attack Lawrence under the circumstances would ruin the Democratic cause.
7729_102255_000020_000004 "But," he added with a significant oath, "boys, we will fight some time!" Thirteen of the captains in the Wakarusa camp were called together, and the situation was duly explained.
7729_102255_000020_000006 He ordered the forces to disband; prisoners were liberated, and with the opportune aid of a furious rain storm the Border Ruffian army gradually melted away.
7729_102255_000021_000000 The truce patched up by this Lawrence treaty was of comparatively short duration.
7729_102255_000021_000003 During and after the contest over the speakership at Washington, each State Legislature became a forum of Kansas debate.
7729_102255_000021_000004 The general public interest in the controversy was shown by discussions carried on by press, pulpit, and in the daily conversation and comment of the people of the Union in every town, hamlet, and neighborhood.
7729_102255_000023_000001 Buford, of Alabama; titus, of Florida; Wilkes, of Virginia; Hampton, of Kentucky; Treadwell, of South Carolina, and others, brought not only enthusiastic leadership, but substantial assistance. Both the factions which had come so near to actual battle in the "Wakarusa war," though nominally disbanded, in reality continued their military organizations,--the free State men through apprehension of danger, the Border Ruffians because of their purpose to crush out opposition.
7729_102255_000024_000000 The vague and double meaning phrases of the Lawrence agreement furnished the earliest causes of a renewal of the quarrel.
7729_102255_000024_000002 "We may have said that we would assist any proper officer in the service of any legal process," they replied, standing upon their interpretation.
7729_102255_000024_000003 This was, of course, the original controversy-slavery burning to enforce her usurpation, freedom determined to defend her birthright.
7729_102255_000024_000005 Little by little, however, the latter became hemmed and bound in the meshes of the various devices and proceedings which the territorial officials evolved from the bogus laws.
7729_102255_000024_000006 President Pierce, in his special message of january twenty fourth, declared what had been done by the Topeka movement to be "of a revolutionary character" which would "become treasonable insurrection if it reach the length of organized resistance."
7729_102255_000025_000003 The people of Lawrence denounced the deed; but the sheriff hoarded up the score for future revenge.
7729_102255_000025_000004 One additional incident served to precipitate the crisis.
7729_102255_000027_000000 Ex Governor Reeder was in attendance on this committee, supplying data, pointing out from personal knowledge sources of information, cross examining witnesses to elicit the hidden truth.
7729_102255_000027_000001 To embarrass this damaging exposure, Judge Lecompte issued a writ against the ex Governor on a frivolous charge of contempt.
7729_102255_000027_000004 No posse was summoned, no further effort made, and Reeder, fearing personal violence, soon fled in disguise.
7729_102255_000027_000005 But the affair was magnified as a crowning proof that the free State men were insurrectionists and outlaws.
7729_102255_000028_000003 From these, again, sprang barricaded and fortified dwellings, camps and scouting parties, finally culminating in roving guerrilla bands, half partisan, half predatory.
7729_102255_000028_000004 Their distinctive characters, however, display one broad and unfailing difference.
7729_102255_000028_000005 The free State men clung to their prairie towns and prairie ravines with all the obstinacy and courage of true defenders of their homes and firesides.
7729_102255_000028_000007 Organized and sustained in the beginning by voluntary contributions from that and distant States, they ended by levying forced contributions, by "pressing" horses, food, or arms from any neighborhood they chanced to visit.
7729_102255_000028_000008 Their assumed character changed with their changing opportunities or necessities.
7729_102255_000028_000009 They were squads of Kansas militia, companies of "peaceful emigrants," or gangs of irresponsible outlaws, to suit the chance, the whim, or the need of the moment.
7729_102255_000032_000001 A propitious moment for carrying it out seemed now to have arrived.
7729_102255_000032_000002 The free State officers and leaders were, thanks to Judge Lecompte's doctrine of constructive treason, under indictment, arrest, or in flight; the settlers were busy with their spring crops; while the pro slavery guerrillas, freshly arrived and full of zeal, were eager for service and distinction.
7729_102255_000032_000006 The Governor refused to interfere to protect the threatened town, though an urgent appeal to do so was made to him by its citizens, who after stormy and divided councils resolved on a policy of non resistance.
7729_102255_000034_000000 They next made application to the marshal, who tauntingly replied that he could not rely on their pledges, and must take the liberty to execute his process in his own time and manner.
7729_102255_000034_000005 Ten days were consumed in these negotiations; but the spirit of vengeance refused to yield.
7729_102255_000035_000000 During the forenoon the deputy marshal rode leisurely into the town attended by less than a dozen men, being neither molested nor opposed. He summoned half a dozen citizens to join his posse, who followed, obeyed, and assisted him.
7729_102255_000035_000001 He continued his pretended search and, to give color to his errand, made two arrests.
7729_102255_000035_000002 The Free State Hotel, a stone building in dimensions fifty by seventy feet, three stories high and handsomely furnished, previously occupied only for lodging rooms, on that day for the first time opened its table accommodations to the public, and provided a free dinner in honor of the occasion.
7729_102255_000035_000003 The marshal and his posse, including Sheriff Jones, went among other invited guests and enjoyed the proffered hospitality.
7729_102255_000035_000006 The military force, partly rabble, partly organized, had meanwhile moved into the town.
7729_102255_000036_000003 Half an hour later, turning a deaf ear to all remonstrance, he gave the proprietors until five o'clock to remove their families and personal property from the Free State Hotel.
7729_102255_000036_000004 Atchison, who had been haranguing the mob, planted his two guns before the building and trained them upon it.
7729_102255_000036_000005 The inmates being removed, at the appointed hour a few cannon balls were fired through the stone walls.
7729_102255_000040_000003 In this incident, contrasting the creative and the destructive spirit of the factions, the Emigrant Aid Society of Massachusetts finds its most honorable and triumphant vindication.
7729_102255_000041_000000 [Relocated Footnote: Governor Robinson being on his way East, the steamboat on which he was traveling stopped at Lexington, Missouri.
7729_102255_000041_000002 In a few days an officer came with a requisition from Governor Shannon, and took the prisoner by land to Westport, and afterwards from there to Kansas City and Leavenworth.
7902_96591_000000_000000 CHAPTER TWELVE.
7902_96591_000001_000000 "You are making a mistake," said Archy softly.
7902_96591_000002_000000 "Oh!"
7902_96591_000003_000000 There was a cry and a quick rustling toward the door.
7902_96591_000004_000000 "Don't-don't cry out; I did not come to frighten you."
7902_96591_000005_000000 "Who are you?"
7902_96591_000006_000000 "I am from the cutter lying off the coast.
7902_96591_000006_000001 You saw me and spoke to me to day when the dog came at me."
7902_96591_000007_000000 There was a low wailing sound which troubled the midshipman, and he said quickly,--
7902_96591_000008_000000 "Can you not believe me?
7902_96591_000008_000001 I did not come to frighten you; you frightened me."
7902_96591_000009_000000 "Then, why are you here?
7902_96591_000009_000001 How dare you break into our house.
7902_96591_000009_000003 I know!"
7902_96591_000010_000001 "I was obliged to come.
7902_96591_000010_000003 I was trying to find out about the smugglers."
7902_96591_000011_000000 "And-and-you have not found out anything?" came in quick, frightened tones.
7902_96591_000012_000000 Archy was silent.
7902_96591_000013_000000 "Why don't you speak, sir?"
7902_96591_000014_000000 "What am I to say?
7902_96591_000014_000001 I am on duty.
7902_96591_000015_000000 "Ah!" came again out of the darkness, in a low wailing tone.
7902_96591_000016_000000 "I wish you would believe me, that I am in as great trouble about it as you are."
7902_96591_000017_000000 "But your men.
7902_96591_000018_000000 "I suppose so.
7902_96591_000018_000001 I don't know," said Archy.
7902_96591_000019_000000 "Don't they know that you are here?"
7902_96591_000021_000000 "But you will go and tell all you have found out?"
7902_96591_000023_000000 "That my father, Sir Risdon Graeme, has smuggled goods here?"
7902_96591_000024_000000 "What else can I do?" replied Archy sadly.
7902_96591_000025_000000 There was a sound of breath being drawn sharply through the teeth, and then the voice seemed changed as the next words came,--
7902_96591_000026_000000 "Do you know what this means?"
7902_96591_000027_000000 Archy was silent.
7902_96591_000029_000000 There was a low burst of sobbing, and the young midshipman felt his own breast swell.
7902_96591_000030_000000 Suddenly the sobbing ceased, and the girl said slowly,--
7902_96591_000031_000000 "You shall not tell.
7902_96591_000031_000001 It is not my father's doing.
7902_96591_000031_000002 He could not help it.
7902_96591_000031_000003 He hates the smugglers.
7902_96591_000031_000004 You shall not tell.
7902_96591_000031_000005 Pray, pray, say you will not!"
7902_96591_000035_000000 "Yes-yes-speak!"
7902_96591_000036_000000 "I must."
7902_96591_000037_000000 "Oh!"
7902_96591_000038_000000 The interjection came as if it were the outcome of sudden passion. There was a quick, rustling sound, and before the boy could realise what was to come, the door was closed, the lock shot into its socket, and he heard the grinding sound of bolts, top and bottom.
7902_96591_000040_000000 "Well!" he exclaimed; "and I felt sorry for her as one might for one's sister at home, and hung back from getting her people into trouble.
7902_96591_000040_000001 Of all the fierce little tartars!
7902_96591_000040_000002 Oh, it's beyond anything!
7902_96591_000042_000000 "I never did!" he exclaimed, after standing listening for a few minutes to see if the girl would repent and return.
7902_96591_000042_000002 If I had been in uniform, she would not have dared."
7902_96591_000043_000000 Cold water came on this idea directly, as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense, and Celia could not have seen him.
7902_96591_000044_000000 "And I meant to save them from trouble if I could, out of respect for them all, and did not believe that such people could stoop to be mixed up with rogues and smugglers.
7902_96591_000044_000001 But, all right!
7902_96591_000044_000002 I've got my duty to do, and I'll do it.
7902_96591_000044_000003 I'll soon show them that I am not going to be played with.
7902_96591_000044_000004 Looked such a nice, lady like girl, and all the time she's a female smuggler, and must have been sitting up to let them in, and lock up after the rascals had done."
7902_96591_000045_000000 Rather hard measure, by the way, to deal out to the anxious girl, who could not rest while Shackle's gang were busy about the place, and had come stealthily down to open the little corner room window, and watch from time to time until they had gone.
7902_96591_000046_000000 "Well," said Archy, as there was no further sound heard, "I'm not going to put up with this.
7902_96591_000046_000001 I'll soon rattle some one up;" and he went sharply to the door, felt for the handle, tried it, and was about to shake it and bang at the panels, when discretion got the better of valour.
7902_96591_000047_000001 They had a valuable cargo hidden in the cellar beneath where he stood, and themselves to save, and naturally they would not hesitate to deal hardly with him, when quite a young, apparently gentle girl treated him as she had done.
7902_96591_000048_000000 "No," he thought to himself, "I don't believe they would kill me, but they would knock me about."
7902_96591_000049_000000 On the whole, he decided that it would not be pleasant to be knocked about.
7902_96591_000049_000001 The kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect, and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape, and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could.
7902_96591_000050_000000 To do this he must scheme, lie hid till morning, then make for the nearest point, and signal for help, unless a boat's crew were already searching for him.
7902_96591_000051_000000 How to escape?
7902_96591_000053_000000 Perhaps there was another way out, and to prove that he went softly round to feel the oak panelling which covered the walls, to come upon a door directly.
7902_96591_000054_000000 Next moment, as he felt his way about, his hand touched an old-fashioned marble mantelpiece.
7902_96591_000055_000000 Fireplace-chimney!
7902_96591_000055_000001 Yes, if other ways failed, he could escape up the chimney.
7902_96591_000056_000000 No, that was too bad.
7902_96591_000056_000002 And if he did, it would only be to reach the roof of the house, and perhaps find no way down.
7902_96591_000057_000001 Then all round the room.
7902_96591_000058_000000 Sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the Hoze were completely gone now, and he set his teeth fast, and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people.
7902_96591_000059_000000 A chair or two.
7902_96591_000059_000001 Then an easy chair.
7902_96591_000059_000002 A narrow table against the wall in two places.
7902_96591_000059_000003 An awkwardly shaped high backed chair with elbows and cushions.
7902_96591_000059_000005 Nothing else in the room, as far as he could make out in the darkness, and if those wretched bars had only been away, how soon he could have escaped!
7902_96591_000060_000000 He went and tried to force his head through, recalling as he did that where a person's head would go the rest of the body would pass.
7902_96591_000060_000001 But there was no chance for his body there, the head would not go first.
7902_96591_000063_000000 "A fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it," he said, "but not in a case like this."
7902_96592_000001_000000 CHAPTER THIRTEEN.
7902_96592_000002_000000 "Sure you've looked round everywhere, boy?"
7902_96592_000003_000000 "Yes, father, quite."
7902_96592_000004_000000 "Nothing left nowhere?
7902_96592_000004_000001 Sure none of the lads chucked anything aside the path when they ran up?"
7902_96592_000005_000000 "Yes, father.
7902_96592_000005_000001 I looked well both sides."
7902_96592_000008_000000 "I'm going home to breakfast."
7902_96592_000009_000000 "Shall I come too, father?"
7902_96592_000010_000000 "no Stop here till Sir Risdon comes down, and tell him I'm very sorry; that we should have cleared out last night, only a born fool saw Jerry Nandy's lobster boat coming into the cove, and came running to say it was a party from the cutter."
7902_96592_000011_000000 "Yes, father."
7902_96592_000012_000000 "Tell him not to be uneasy; 'tis all right, and I'll have everything clear away to night."
7902_96592_000013_000000 The dull sound of departing steps, and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin where Archy Raystoke lay with his heavy eyelids pressed down by sleep.
7902_96592_000014_000000 "What a queer dream!" he thought to himself.
7902_96592_000014_000001 "No; it couldn't be a dream.
7902_96592_000014_000002 He must be awake.
7902_96592_000014_000003 But how queer for Mr Gurr to be talking like that to Andrew Teal, the boy who helped the cook!
7902_96592_000014_000004 And why did Andy call Mr Gurr father?"
7902_96592_000015_000000 There was an interval of thinking over this knotty question, during which the low whistling went on.
7902_96592_000016_000001 "But what did Mr Gurr mean about going home to breakfast?
7902_96592_000016_000002 And I'm hungry too. Time I was up, I suppose."
7902_96592_000017_000000 He gave himself a twist, and was about to turn out of his sleeping place, and then opened his eyes widely, and stared about him, too much overcome still by his heavy sleep to quite comprehend why it was that he was in a gloomy, oak panelled, poorly furnished room, staring at an iron barred open window.
7902_96592_000018_000000 No: he was not dreaming, for he was looking out on the sea, over which a faint mist hung like wreaths of smoke.
7902_96592_000018_000001 It was just before sunrise too, for there were flecks of orange high up in the sky.
7902_96592_000019_000000 What did it mean?
7902_96592_000020_000000 The answer came like a flash.
7902_96592_000021_000000 He had been fast asleep, and those words had awakened him.
7902_96592_000022_000000 What did they say?--false alarm-tell Sir Risdon they would clear all away to night-see if anything had been left about-lobster boat!
7902_96592_000024_000000 He jumped up from the chair feeling horribly stiff, and looked steadily round for a way to escape before it was too late.
7902_96592_000024_000001 Once out of that room he could ran, and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunt him down.
7902_96592_000025_000000 "Oh, those bars!" he mentally exclaimed, and he was advancing toward them, when just as he drew near, there was a rustling noise under the window, a couple of hands seized the bars, there was a scratching of boot toes against stone work, and Ram's face appeared to gaze into the room by intention, but into the astonished countenance of the young midshipman instead.
7902_96592_000027_000001 I was wondering why that window was open."
7902_96592_000028_000000 "Here, quick!
7902_96592_000028_000001 Go round and open the door.
7902_96592_000028_000002 I was shut in last night by mistake."
7902_96592_000029_000000 "Oh!" said Ram looking puzzled.
7902_96592_000029_000002 It was you father kicked for shirking, and-My!-- well: I hardly knowed you."
7902_96592_000030_000000 "Nonsense!
7902_96592_000030_000001 Come round and open the door.
7902_96592_000030_000002 I've been shut in all night."
7902_96592_000031_000001 "Think I don't know you, Mr Orficer? Where's your fine clothes and your sword?
7902_96592_000031_000002 Here, what made you dress up like that?"
7902_96592_000032_000000 "You're mistaken," said Archy gruffly, as he made a feeble struggle to keep up the character he had assumed.
7902_96592_000033_000000 "Won't do," said Ram quickly.
7902_96592_000033_000001 "I know you.
7902_96592_000033_000003 Who locked you in?"
7902_96592_000034_000000 "Will you come round and open the door?" said Archy in an angry whisper.
7902_96592_000035_000000 "Oh, of course," replied the boy grinning; and he dropped down, rushed through the bushes, and disappeared from view.
7902_96592_000036_000000 Archy stepped back to the door listening, but there was not a sound.
7902_96592_000037_000000 "He has gone to give the alarm," thought the prisoner, and he looked excitedly round for a way of escape.
7902_96592_000038_000000 Nothing but the chimney presented itself.
7902_96592_000038_000001 The door was too strong to attack, and he remembered the three fastenings.
7902_96592_000040_000000 And be stuck there, and dragged out like a rabbit by the hind legs from his hole!
7902_96592_000041_000000 "No; I've degraded myself enough," he said angrily, "and there are sure to be bars across.
7902_96592_000043_000000 Labour in vain.
7902_96592_000044_000000 Turning sharply, he looked about the room; then, after glancing ruefully at the bright little weapon, halfway up the blade of a rich deep blue, in which was figured a pattern in gold, he yielded to necessity, and began to chop at the top bar of the grate, so as to nick the edges of his weapon and make it saw like.
7902_96592_000045_000000 The result was not very satisfactory, but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more, producing a grating, ear assailing sound, as he found that now he did make a little impression,--so little though, that the probability was, if he kept on working well for twenty four hours, he would not get through.
7902_96592_000046_000000 But at the end of five minutes he stopped, and thrust back the dirk into its sheath.
7902_96592_000048_000000 It was a very faint hope, and one he felt not likely to be realised, and he returned once more to the window, with the intention of resuming his task, when he heard the bushes pressed aside by some one coming, and directly after the bars were seized as before.
7902_96592_000048_000001 Ram sprang up, found a resting place for his toes, and looked in, grinning at him.
7902_96592_000050_000000 "Yes.
7902_96592_000050_000001 Come round and open the door."
7902_96592_000051_000000 "What'll yer give me?"
7902_96592_000052_000000 "Anything I can," cried Archy eagerly.
7902_96592_000054_000000 "No; I can't part with that."
7902_96592_000055_000000 "Ha! Ha!
7902_96592_000056_000000 "But I'll-yes, I'll give you a guinea, if you will let me out."
7902_96592_000057_000000 "Guinea?" said the boy.
7902_96592_000058_000001 Be quick, there's a good fellow.
7902_96592_000058_000002 I want to get away at once."
7902_96592_000059_000000 "Not you," said the boy jeeringly.
7902_96592_000059_000001 "It would be a pity.
7902_96592_000059_000002 I say, do you know what you look like?"
7902_96592_000060_000000 "A fisher boy."
7902_96592_000061_000000 "Not you.
7902_96592_000061_000001 Only a sham.
7902_96592_000061_000002 Why, your clothes don't fit you, and your cap's put on all skew rew.
7902_96592_000061_000003 Don't look a bit like a fisher lad, and never will."
7902_96592_000062_000000 "Never mind about that; let me out of this place."
7902_96592_000063_000000 "What for?" cried Ram.
7902_96592_000064_000000 "Because I want my liberty."
7902_96592_000065_000000 "Not you.
7902_96592_000065_000001 Looks comf'table enough as you are.
7902_96592_000066_000000 "I told you, a fisher boy!" cried Archy impatiently, but trying not to offend his visitor, who possessed the power of conferring freedom, by speaking sharply.
7902_96592_000067_000001 Look like a wild beast in a cage.
7902_96592_000067_000002 Like a monkey."
7902_96592_000068_000000 "You insolent-"
7902_96592_000070_000000 "It was your turn yesterday, it's mine to day.
7902_96592_000070_000001 What a game!
7902_96592_000070_000002 You laughed and fleered at me when I was on the cutter's deck.
7902_96592_000070_000005 Just like a big monkey in a show."
7902_96592_000071_000000 "Look here, sir!" said Archy, losing his temper.
7902_96592_000071_000001 "Gentlemen don't fight with low, common fellows like you, but if you do not come round and let me out, next time we meet I'll have a bit of rope's end ready for you."
7902_96592_000072_000000 Ram showed his white teeth, as he burst out with a long, low fit of laughter.
7902_96592_000073_000000 "You rope's end me!" he said.
7902_96592_000073_000001 "Why, I could tie you up in a knot, and heave you off the cliff any day.
7902_96592_000073_000002 What a game!
7902_96592_000073_000005 Go back aboard, and put on your uniform.
7902_96592_000073_000006 Ha!
7902_96592_000073_000007 Ha!
7902_96592_000074_000000 "Once more; will you come and let me out?"
7902_96592_000075_000000 "no I'm going to keep you here till the gentlefolks get up, and then I'll bring 'em round to see the monkey in his cage, just like they do in the shows, when you pay a penny.
7902_96592_000075_000001 See you for nothing, middy.
7902_96592_000075_000002 I say, where's your sword?
7902_96592_000075_000003 Why don't you draw it, and come out and fight? I'll fight you with a stick."
7902_96592_000077_000000 To his astonishment the boy did not flinch, but thrust his own arms through, placing them about the middy's waist, clenching his hands behind, and uttering a sharp whistle.
7902_96592_000078_000000 It was a trap, and the midshipman understood it now.
7902_96592_000079_000000 "Now a handkerchief," said the gruff voice.
7902_96592_000079_000001 "Fold it wide.
7902_96592_000079_000002 Be ready!"
7902_96592_000080_000000 The midshipman gave his head a jerk, but the effort was vain, for the hand over his eyes gave place to a broad handkerchief, which was tightly tied behind, and then a fierce voice whispered in his ear,--
7902_96592_000081_000000 "Keep still, or you'll get your weasand slit.
7902_96594_000001_000000 "Seemed in good spirits last night, Mr Gurr, eh?"
7902_96594_000002_000001 Oh yes."
7902_96594_000003_000000 "I mean liked his job?"
7902_96594_000005_000001 Time we had some news of him, eh?"
7902_96594_000006_000000 "Yes, sir; but he may turn up on the cliff at any moment."
7902_96594_000007_000000 "Yes.
7902_96594_000007_000001 Men quite ready?"
7902_96594_000008_000000 "Yes, sir."
7902_96594_000009_000000 "That's right.
7902_96594_000009_000001 Of course, well armed?"
7902_96594_000010_000000 "Yes, sir; you did tell me.
7902_96594_000010_000001 Soon as the signal comes, we shall push off.
7902_96594_000012_000000 "Very unlucky, sir.
7902_96594_000012_000001 Seems to me like going eel fishing with your bare hand."
7902_96594_000013_000000 "Worse.
7902_96594_000013_000001 You might catch one by accident."
7902_96594_000014_000000 "So shall we yet, sir.
7902_96594_000014_000001 These fellows are very cunning, but we shall be too many for them one of these days."
7902_96594_000015_000000 "Dear me!
7902_96594_000015_000001 Dear me!" said the little lieutenant after a few more turns up and down.
7902_96594_000016_000000 "Well, sir," said the master, hesitating, "smugglers are smugglers."
7902_96594_000017_000000 "Mr Gurr," said the little lieutenant, raising himself up on his toes, so as to be as high as possible, "will you have the goodness to talk sense?"
7902_96594_000018_000000 "Certainly, sir."
7902_96594_000019_000000 "Smugglers are smugglers, indeed.
7902_96594_000019_000001 What did you suppose I thought they were?
7902_96594_000019_000002 Oysters?"
7902_96594_000020_000000 "Beg pardon, sir; didn't mean any harm."
7902_96594_000021_000002 You must go and find him.
7902_96594_000021_000003 I'm getting very anxious about Mr Raystoke."
7902_96594_000022_000000 "Start at once, sir?"
7902_96594_000023_000000 "No, wait another half hour.
7902_96594_000023_000001 Very ill advised thing to do.
7902_96594_000025_000000 "Yes.
7902_96594_000025_000001 A great pity.
7902_96594_000025_000002 I ought not to have listened to you; but in my anxiety to leave no stone unturned to capture some of these scoundrels, I was ready to do anything."
7902_96594_000026_000000 "Very true, sir."
7902_96594_000027_000000 "Now, my good fellow, what do you mean by that?"
7902_96594_000028_000000 "It was only an observation, sir."
7902_96594_000029_000000 "Then I must request that you will not make it again.
7902_96594_000029_000002 Do you think I should say a thing that was false?"
7902_96594_000030_000000 "Beg pardon, sir.
7902_96594_000032_000000 "Yes, sir; of course."
7902_96594_000035_000000 "Mr Gurr!"
7902_96594_000036_000000 "Yes, sir."
7902_96594_000038_000000 "Beg pardon, sir.
7902_96594_000041_000000 By this time the little lieutenant was scanning the cliffs again, and the master took off his hat and wiped his forehead.
7902_96594_000043_000000 Dirty Dick screwed up his mouth as if to speak, but only stared.
7902_96594_000044_000000 "Don't turn yourself into a figurehead of an old wreck sir.
7902_96594_000044_000001 What do you want?"
7902_96594_000045_000000 "Leave to go ashore, sir."
7902_96594_000046_000000 "Well, you're going soon as the skipper orders."
7902_96594_000047_000000 "I mean all alone by myself, sir."
7902_96594_000048_000000 "What for?
7902_96594_000048_000001 There aren't a public house for ten miles."
7902_96594_000049_000000 "Didn't mean that."
7902_96594_000050_000001 Speak out, and don't do the double shuffle all over my clean deck."
7902_96594_000051_000000 "No, sir."
7902_96594_000052_000001 Now, then, why do you want to go ashore?"
7902_96594_000053_000001 Beginning to feel scarred about him."
7902_96594_000054_000001 "Scared about whom?"
7902_96594_000056_000000 "Yes, you did, sir.
7902_96594_000056_000002 You meant that you were getting uneasy about Mr Raystoke's prolonged absence."
7902_96594_000057_000000 "Yes sir, that's it," said Dick eagerly.
7902_96594_000060_000000 "Do you hear me, sir?" cried the lieutenant.
7902_96594_000061_000000 "Yes, sir," said the man humbly.
7902_96594_000061_000001 "Shall I go at once sir?"
7902_96594_000062_000000 "no Wait.
7902_96594_000062_000001 Keep a sharp look out on the cliff to see if Mr Raystoke is making signals for a boat.
7902_96594_000062_000002 I daresay he has been there all the time, only you took up my attention with your chatter."
7902_96594_000063_000000 He swung round, walked aft and began sweeping the shore again with his glass, while the master and Dick exchanged glances which meant a great deal.
7902_96594_000066_000000 At last the little lieutenant could bear the anxiety no longer.
7902_96594_000067_000001 "Now, Mr Gurr," he said, "I'm only going to say one thing to you in the way of instructions."
7902_96594_000068_000000 "Yes, sir."
7902_96594_000070_000000 "Beg pardon, sir," said the master deprecatingly.
7902_96594_000071_000000 "I say, sir, I have only one order to give you.
7902_96594_000072_000001 He's a Tartar; that's what he is.
7902_96594_000072_000003 Don't see me getting out o' temper with everybody, and spitting and swearing like a mad Tom cat.
7902_96594_000072_000004 Hang the boy!
7902_96594_000077_000000 "Steady!
7902_96595_000000_000000 "Runned away."
7902_96595_000001_000001 You won't see him again."
7902_96595_000002_000000 "Won't I?" muttered Gurr between his teeth.
7902_96595_000002_000001 "I'll let some of you see about that, my fine fellows."
7902_96595_000003_000000 He led his men on, stopping at each cluster of cottages and shabby little farm to ask suspiciously, as if he felt certain the person he questioned was hiding the truth.
7902_96595_000004_000000 But he always came out again to his men with an anxious look in his eyes, and generally ranged up alongside of Dick.
7902_96595_000007_000000 "What!
7902_96595_000007_000001 Mr Raystoke, sir?
7902_96595_000007_000002 Don't be a fool."
7902_96595_000008_000000 "No, sir," replied Dick humbly, and the men tramped on with a couple of open mouthed, barefooted boys following them to stare at their cutlasses and pistols.
7902_96595_000011_000000 "What?"
7902_96595_000012_000000 "Chucked him off yonder."
7902_96595_000013_000000 Gurr glanced round to see if the men were looking, and then said rather huskily but kindly,--
7902_96595_000014_000000 "In ord'nary, Dick, my lad, no; but when smugglers finds themselves up in corners where they can't get away, they turns and fights like rats, and when they fights they bites."
7902_96595_000015_000000 "Ah!" ejaculated Dick sadly.
7902_96595_000016_000000 "You're only a common sailor, Dick, and I'm your officer, but though I speak sharp unto you, I respect you, Dick, for you like that lad."
7902_96595_000019_000000 Dick sighed, and then all at once he spat in his fist, rubbed his hands together and clenched them, a hard, fierce aspect coming into his rough dark face, which seemed to promise severe retaliation if anything had happened to the young officer.
7902_96595_000020_000000 There was nowhere else to search as far as Gurr could see, save the little farm in the hollow, and the black looking stone house up on the hill among the trees.
7902_96595_000022_000000 "Morning, marm," said Gurr; "sorry to trouble you, but-"
7902_96595_000023_000000 "Oh, sir," interrupted Mrs Shackle, "surely you are not going to tumble over my house again!
7902_96595_000023_000001 I do assure you there's nothing here but what you may see."
7902_96595_000024_000000 "If you'd let me finish, you'd know," said Gurr gruffly.
7902_96595_000024_000001 "One of our boys is missing.
7902_96595_000024_000002 Seen him up here?
7902_96595_000024_000003 Boy 'bout seventeen with a red cap."
7902_96595_000026_000000 "Don't know as he has been seen about here, do you?" said Gurr, looking at her searchingly.
7902_96595_000027_000000 "No, sir."
7902_96595_000028_000001 Come ashore yesterday."
7902_96595_000029_000000 Mrs Shackle shook her head.
7902_96595_000030_000000 "Thank ye!--No, Dick," continued the master, turning back to where the men were waiting, and unconsciously brushing against the bush behind which the middy had hidden himself, "that woman knows nothing.
7902_96595_000030_000001 If she knew evil had come to the poor lad, her face would tell tales like print.
7902_96595_000030_000002 Hi!
7902_96595_000030_000003 You, sir," he said, going towards where Jemmy stood grinning.
7902_96595_000034_000000 "Look here, my lad, one of our boys is missing.
7902_96595_000034_000001 Came ashore yesterday, lad of seventeen in a red cap."
7902_96595_000035_000000 "Oh!" said Jemmy with a vacant look.
7902_96595_000036_000000 "I said a lad 'bout seventeen, in a red cap like yours," said Gurr very shortly.
7902_96595_000037_000001 "Have he runned away?"
7902_96595_000039_000000 The man shook his head, and stared as if he didn't half understand the drift of what was said.
7902_96595_000040_000000 Gurr turned angrily away, and to find himself facing Dick.
7902_96595_000041_000000 "Well, seen anything suspicious?"
7902_96595_000043_000000 "Scratch them then."
7902_96595_000044_000001 "I mean to have a turn at that chap, Master Gurr, sir.
7902_96595_000044_000002 I feel as if I had him for 'bout quarter hour I could knock something out of him."
7902_96595_000045_000000 "Nonsense!
7902_96595_000045_000002 Now, my lads, forward!"
7902_96595_000046_000000 Jemmy Dadd's countenance changed from its vacant aspect to one full of cunning, as the party from the cutter moved off, but it became dull and semi idiotic again, for Gurr turned sharply round.
7902_96595_000047_000000 "Here, my lad, where's your master?"
7902_96595_000048_000000 "Eh?"
7902_96595_000049_000000 "I say, where's your master?"
7902_96595_000053_000000 "I dunno," muttered Dick, "and a man can't be sure.
7902_96595_000055_000000 "Never mind the rabbits, lads," cried Gurr angrily; "we want to find Mr Raystoke."
7902_96595_000057_000000 Gurr saluted, and stated his business, while the baronet, who had turned sallower and more careworn than his lot drew a breath full of relief.
7902_96595_000058_000000 "One of your ship boys?" he said.
7902_96595_000059_000000 "A lad, looking like a common sailor, and wearing a red cap."
7902_96595_000060_000000 "No," said Sir Risdon.
7902_96595_000060_000001 "I have seen no one answering to the description here."
7902_96595_000061_000000 "Beg pardon, sir, but can you, as a gentleman, assure me that he is not here?"
7902_96595_000062_000000 "Certainly," said Sir Risdon.
7902_96595_000062_000001 "You have seen no one?" he continued, turning to Lady Graeme.
7902_96595_000064_000000 "That's enough, sir; but may I ask you, if you do see or hear anything of such a lad, you will send a messenger off to the cutter?"
7902_96595_000065_000000 "It is hardly right to enlist me in the search for one of your deserters," said Sir Risdon coldly.
7902_96595_000067_000000 "Surely!" cried Sir Risdon excitedly.
7902_96595_000067_000001 "No, no,--you must be mistaken. A boyish prank.
7902_96595_000067_000002 No one about here would injure a boy."
7902_96595_000071_000000 "I suppose there is a good deal of smuggling on the coast," said Sir Risdon coldly, as he thought of his vault.
7902_96595_000072_000000 "Yes sir, there is, and it will go hard with the people who are caught having any dealings with the smugglers."
7902_96595_000073_000000 Lady Graeme looked ghastly.
7902_96595_000075_000000 Sir Risdon dared not trust himself to speak, but darted an agonised glance at his wife.
7902_96595_000076_000000 "However, sir, I'm not on that sort of business now," continued Gurr sternly.
7902_96595_000076_000001 "Want to find that boy.
7902_96595_000076_000002 Good day.
7902_96595_000076_000003 Now, my lads."
7902_96595_000077_000000 The men marched off, and Sir Risdon stood watching them.
7902_96595_000079_000000 "Don't blame me," he said sadly.
7902_96595_000079_000001 "I loathe the whole business, but when I saw my wife and child suffering almost from want of the very necessaries of life, and the temptation came in the shape of presents from that man, I could not resist-I was too weak.
7902_96595_000079_000003 But I am justly punished, and never again will I allow myself to be made an accessory to these lawless deeds."
7902_96595_000081_000000 "I do not know."
7902_96595_000082_000000 "You do not know?"
7902_96595_000083_000000 "no
7902_96595_000083_000001 The only way in which I could allow myself to act was to keep myself in complete ignorance of the going and coming of these people.
7975_280057_000005_000001 BOYHOOD DAYS
7975_280057_000006_000001 These hatreds were soon to make trouble for me of which I had never dreamed.
7975_280057_000007_000000 Mine was a happy childhood.
7975_280057_000008_000000 My people had always been prominent, politically.
7975_280057_000008_000001 It was born in the blood.
7975_280057_000008_000003 The Youngers came from Strasburg, and helped to rule there when it was a free city. Henry Washington Younger, my father, represented Jackson county three times in the legislature, and was also judge of the county court.
7975_280057_000008_000005 Mother was descended from the Sullivans, Ladens and Percivals of South Carolina, the Taylors of Virginia and the Fristoes of Tennessee, and my grandfather Fristoe was a grand nephew of Chief Justice john Marshall of Virginia.
7975_280057_000009_000000 Naturally we were Southerners in sympathy and in fact.
7975_280057_000009_000001 My father owned slaves and his children were reared in ease, though the border did not then abound in what would now be called luxury.
7975_280057_000009_000002 The railroads had not reached Jackson county, and wild game was plentiful on my father's farm on Big Creek near Lee's Summit.
7975_280057_000009_000003 I cannot remember when I did not know how to shoot.
7975_280057_000009_000005 But this garden spot was destined to be a bloody battle ground when the nation divided.
7975_280057_000010_000001 My brother james was born january fifteenth eighteen forty eight, john in eighteen fifty one, and Robert in December, eighteen fifty three.
7975_280057_000010_000002 My eldest brother, Richard, died in eighteen sixty.
7975_280057_000010_000003 This was before the conflicts and troubles centered on our home that planted a bitterness in my young heart which cried out for revenge and this feeling was only accentuated by the cruelties of war which followed.
7975_280057_000010_000004 I refer in particular to the shameful and cowardly murder of my father for money which he was known to have in his possession, and the cruel treatment of my mother at the hands of the Missouri Militia.
7975_280057_000010_000005 My father was in the employ of the United States government and had the mail contract for five hundred miles.
7975_280057_000010_000006 While in Washington attending to some business regarding this matter, a raid was made by the Kansas Jayhawkers upon the livery stable and stage line for several miles out into the country, the robbers also looting his store and destroying his property generally.
7975_280057_000010_000007 When my father returned from Washington and learned of these outrages he went to kansas city missouri., headquarters of the State Militia, to see if anything could be done.
7975_280057_000010_000008 He had started back to Harrisonville in a buggy, but was waylaid one mile south of Westport, a suburb of Kansas City, and brutally murdered; falling out of his buggy into the road with three mortal bullet wounds.
7975_280057_000010_000009 His horse was tied to a tree and his body left lying where it fell.
7975_280057_000010_000010 mrs Washington Wells and her son, Samuel, on the road home from Kansas City to Lee's Summit, recognized the body as that of my father.
7975_280057_000010_000013 Walley and his gang of the Missouri Militia, whose hands are stained with the blood of my father.
7975_280057_000013_000000 Walley afterwards caused the arrest of my cousins fearing that they had recognized him and his men.
7975_280057_000013_000001 These young women were thrown into an old rickety, two story house, located between fourteenth and fifteenth streets on Grand avenue, kansas city missouri.
7975_280057_000013_000002 Twenty five other women were also prisoners there at that time, including three of my own sisters.
7975_280057_000013_000003 The down stairs was used as a grocery store.
7975_280057_000013_000004 After six months of living death in this trap, the house was secretly undermined and fell with the prisoners, only five of whom escaped injury or death.
7975_280057_000013_000005 It was noted that the groceryman had moved his stock of groceries from the building in time to save it from ruin, showing that the wrecking of the house was planned in cold blood, with the murder of my sisters and cousins and the other unfortunate women in mind.
7975_280057_000013_000007 mrs McCorkle jumped from the window of the house and escaped.
7975_280057_000013_000009 A Virginian by birth, and a school teacher for many years in various parts of Missouri, he was well known throughout the state as an active sympathizer with the South.
7975_280057_000013_000010 His home was friendly to every Confederate soldier and scout in the West. Information, newspapers, and the like, left there, were certain to be kept for the right hands.
7975_280057_000014_000000 In september eighteen sixty three, soldiers ransacked the Harris home, stole everything they considered valuable, and burned the house.
7975_280057_000014_000001 A daughter, Kate, who was asleep upstairs, was rescued from the flames by her sister.
7975_280057_000014_000002 As the raiders left, one of them shouted:
7975_280057_000015_000001 Why don't you call on Cole Younger now?"
7975_280057_000016_000000 Among the women who lost their lives was Miss Josephine Anderson, whose cruel death simply blighted her brother's life and so filled him with determination to revenge that he afterward became the most desperate of desperate men.
7975_280057_000016_000001 "Quantrell sometimes spares, but Anderson never," became a tradition of the Kansas line.
7975_280057_000016_000002 Before he died in a skirmish with Northern troops in eighteen sixty four, he had tied fifty three knots in a silken cord which he carried in his buckskin pouch.
7975_280057_000017_000000 Every knot represented a human life.
7975_280057_000018_000000 Anderson was then ripe for the raid on Lawrence.
7975_280057_000019_000000 All this was cruelty, indeed, and enough to harden and embitter the softest of hearts, but it was mild compared with the continuous suffering and torture imposed upon my mother during the years from eighteen sixty two to eighteen seventy.
7975_280057_000020_000000 After the murder of my father she was so annoyed at her home in Harrisonville that she sought peace at her country residence eight and a half miles north of town.
7975_280057_000020_000003 Nothing could have proved her faithfulness more effectually than an incident connected with one of my stolen visits home.
7975_280057_000020_000004 I went home one night to get medicine for the boys wounded in the battle of Lone Jack whom I was nursing in the woods some miles away.
7975_280057_000020_000005 As I sat talking with my mother two of my brothers watched at the windows.
7975_280057_000020_000006 There was soon the dreaded cry, "the militia are surrounding the house," and in the excitement which followed, "Suse" dashed open the door to find a score of bayonets in her face.
7975_280057_000021_000000 Two months after this incident the same persecutors again entered our home in the dead of the night, and, at the point of a pistol, tried to force my mother to set fire to her own home.
7975_280057_000021_000002 This they agreed to do on condition that she put the torch to her house at daybreak.
7975_280057_000022_000000 I have always felt that the exposure to which she was subjected on this cruel journey, too hard even for a man to take, was the direct cause of her death.
7975_280057_000022_000001 From Harrisonville she went to Waverly, where she was hounded continually.
7975_280057_000022_000002 One of the conditions upon which her life was spared was that she would report at Lexington weekly.
7975_280057_000023_000000 One of the numerous books purporting to be a history of my life states with the utmost soberness that, as a boy, I was cruel to dumb animals and to my schoolmates, and, as for my teachers, to them I was a continual trouble and annoyance.
7975_280057_000023_000001 A hundred of my friends and schoolmates will bear me out in the statement that, far from being cruel to either dumb animals or human beings, I was always regarded as kind and considerate to both.
7975_280057_000024_000000 One of my old school teachers, whom I have never seen since the spring or summer of eighteen sixty two, is Stephen b Elkins, senator from West Virginia.
7975_280057_000025_000001 They were good people and among the pioneers on the western border of Missouri.
7975_280057_000025_000002 The Younger brothers maintained a good reputation in the community where they lived and were well esteemed, as were their parents, for their good conduct and character.
7975_280057_000025_000004 On reaching the camp the first person I saw whom I knew was Cole Younger.
7975_280057_000025_000005 When I was taken prisoner, I expected to be shot without ceremony.
7975_280057_000025_000006 As soon as I saw Cole Younger I felt a sense of relief because I had known him and his parents long and favorably, and as soon as I got a chance I told him frankly what I feared and that I hoped he would manage to take care of me and save me from being killed.
7975_280057_000025_000007 He assured me he would do all he could to protect me. Cole Younger told Quantrell that my father and brother were in the rebel army and were good fighters, and that I had stayed at home to take care of my mother; that I was a good fellow and a non combatant.
7975_280057_000025_000008 This occurred just before I entered the Union army, and it was generally known, and I am sure Cole knew, that I was strongly for the Union and about to enter the army.

7975_280063_000002_000002 Gideon w Thompson.
7975_280063_000002_000004 Hays in recruiting a regiment around my old home.
7975_280063_000003_000002 Joseph o Shelby.
7975_280063_000004_000001 Hays had encamped after Independence.
7975_280063_000006_000002 At the same time he was obtaining from the Chicago and saint Louis papers and other sources, information about the northern armies, which was conveyed by couriers to Confederate officers in the south, and he kept concealed along the Missouri river skiffs and ferry boats to enable the Confederate officers, recruiting north of the river, to have free access to the south.
7975_280063_000011_000001 Accordingly I was shortly awakened to accompany him to Lone Jack, where he would personally make known the situation to the other colonels.
7975_280063_000013_000001 Hays and I arrived, had his men drawn up in line of battle, while the officers were holding a council in his quarters.
7975_280063_000014_000001 Cockrell.
7975_280063_000014_000003 We want to attack Foster and beat him in the morning. He will just be a nice breakfast spell."
7975_280063_000016_000000 "No, Lieutenant, I'll go, too."
7975_280063_000017_000000 On the way back he asked me what I thought about Foster being a "breakfast spell."
7975_280063_000018_000001 "He might be all right for dinner."
7975_280063_000020_000002 Sherman's characterization-"War is hell."
7975_280063_000021_000000 Jackman, with a party of thirty seasoned men, charged the Indiana guns, and captured them, but Major Foster led a gallant charge against the invaders, and recaptured the pieces.
7975_280063_000021_000001 We were out of ammunition, and were helpless, had the fight been pressed.
7975_280063_000022_000000 Riding to the still house where we had left the wagon munitions we had taken a few days before at Independence, I obtained a fresh supply and started for the action on the gallop.
7975_280063_000023_000002 They did mark my clothes in one or two places, however.
7975_280063_000024_000000 Major Foster, in a letter to Judge George m Bennett of Minneapolis, said:
7975_280063_000025_000000 "During the progress of the fight my attention was called to a young Confederate riding in front of the Confederate line, distributing ammunition to the men from what seemed to be a 'splint basket.' He rode along under a most galling fire from our side the entire length of the Confederate lines, and when he had at last disappeared, our boys recognized his gallantry in ringing cheers.
7975_280063_000025_000002 About nine thirty a m, I was shot down.
7975_280063_000025_000003 The wounded of both forces were gathered up and were placed in houses.
7975_280063_000025_000004 My brother and I, both supposed to be mortally wounded, were in the same bed.
7975_280063_000025_000005 About an hour after the Confederates left the field, the ranking officer who took command when I became unconscious, gathered his men together and returned to Lexington.
7975_280063_000025_000006 Soon after the Confederates returned.
7975_280063_000025_000007 The first man who entered my room was a guerrilla, followed by a dozen or more men who seemed to obey him.
7975_280063_000025_000008 He was personally known to me and had been my enemy from before the war.
7975_280063_000025_000009 He said he and his men had just shot a lieutenant of a Cass county company whom they found wounded and that he would shoot me and my brother.
7975_280063_000025_000011 Several Confederates followed the young Confederate into the room, and I heard them call him Cole Younger.
7975_280063_000025_000013 Cockrell (in command of the Confederate forces) and stated the case to him.
7975_280063_000025_000014 He also called the young man Cole Younger and directed him to guard the house, which he did.
7975_280063_000025_000017 I believe he still retains those qualities and would prove himself as good a citizen as we have among us if set free, and would fight for the Stars and Stripes as fearlessly as he did for the Southern flag. I have never seen him since the battle of Lone Jack.
7975_280063_000025_000018 I know much of the conditions and circumstances under which the Youngers were placed after the war, and knowing this, I have great sympathy for them.
7975_280063_000027_000000 Quantrell was not in the fight at Lone Jack at all, but Jarrette and Gregg did come up with some of Quantrell's men just at the end and were in the chase back toward Lexington.
7975_280076_000002_000001 LAURELS UNSOUGHT
7975_280076_000003_000000 Although every book purporting to narrate the lives of the Younger brothers has told of the Liberty robbery, and implied that we had a part in it, the Youngers were not suspected at that time, nor for a long time afterward.
7975_280076_000003_000002 Jim White and j f Edmunson were arrested in saint Joseph, but were promptly released, their preliminary examination failing to connect them with the raid in any way.
7975_280076_000005_000001 This raid was accompanied by bloodshed, Judge McLain, the banker, being shot, though not fatally.
7975_280076_000006_000001 Jailer Griffin and his fifteen-year old son were killed there. Warrants were issued for a number of the old guerrillas, including Allen Parmer, afterward the husband of Susie james, although he was working in Kansas City at the time, and proved an absolute alibi.
7975_280076_000007_000002 Jim and john were at home at Lee's Summit.
7975_280076_000008_000001 The romancers have connected Jim and me with that, when as a matter of fact I was in Louisiana, Jim and Bob were at Dallas, and john was in California.
7975_280076_000010_000002 It was charged that Arthur McCoy or a c McCoy and myself had been participants in the Gad's Hill affair and the two stage robberies.
7975_280076_000011_000000 november fifteenth eighteen seventy four, I wrote a letter to my brother in law, Lycargus a Jones, which was published in part in the Pleasant Hill Review november twenty sixth, the editor having in the meantime inquired into the statements of facts and satisfied himself of their truth.
7975_280076_000011_000001 The parts of this letter now relevant are as follows:
7975_280076_000013_000000 You may use this letter in your own way.
7975_280076_000013_000001 I will give you this outline and sketch of my whereabouts and actions at the time of certain robberies with which I am charged.
7975_280076_000013_000002 At the time of the Gallatin bank robbery I was gathering cattle in Ellis county texas; cattle that I bought from Pleas Taylor and Rector.
7975_280076_000013_000003 This can be proved by both of them; also by Sheriff Barkley and fifty other respectable men of that county.
7975_280076_000013_000007 Ridge's.
7975_280076_000014_000000 The gate at the fair grounds was robbed that fall.
7975_280076_000014_000001 I was in Jackson county at the time.
7975_280076_000014_000002 I left r p Rose's that morning, went down the Independence road, stopped at dr Noland's, and got some pills.
7975_280076_000014_000003 Brother john was with me.
7975_280076_000014_000004 I went through Independence and from there to Ace Webb's.
7975_280076_000014_000005 There I took dinner and then went to dr l w Twyman's.
7975_280076_000014_000006 Stayed there until after supper, then went to Silas Hudspeth's and stayed all night.
7975_280076_000014_000007 This was the day the gate was robbed at Kansas City.
7975_280076_000014_000008 Next day john and I went to Kansas City.
7975_280076_000014_000009 We crossed the river at Blue Mills and went up on the other side.
7975_280076_000014_000010 Our business there was to see e p West.
7975_280076_000014_000011 He was not at home, but the family will remember that we were there.
7975_280076_000014_000012 We crossed on the bridge, stayed in the city all night and the next morning we rode up through the city.
7975_280076_000014_000013 I met several of my friends.
7975_280076_000014_000014 Among them was Bob Hudspeth.
7975_280076_000014_000019 Where he got his authority I don't know, but one thing I do know, he had none from me.
7975_280076_000014_000020 We were not on good terms at the time, nor have we been for several years.
7975_280076_000014_000021 From that time on mine and John's names have been connected with the james brothers.
7975_280076_000014_000022 john hadn't seen either of them for eighteen months before his death.
7975_280076_000014_000023 And as for a c McCoy, john never saw him in his life.
7975_280076_000014_000024 I knew a c McCoy during the war, but have never seen him since, notwithstanding the Appleton City paper says he has been with us in that county for two years.
7975_280076_000015_000000 Poor john, he has been hunted down and shot like a wild beast, and never was a boy more innocent.

7975_280076_000017_000001 There were fifty or a hundred persons there who will testify in any court that john and I were there.
7975_280076_000017_000005 As there was no other robbery committed until January, I will come to that time.
7975_280076_000017_000006 About the last of December, eighteen seventy three, I arrived in Carroll parish, Louisiana.
7975_280076_000017_000007 I stayed there until the eighth of February, eighteen seventy four.

7975_280076_000019_000000 On reading since my release the pretended history of my life I find that I was wrong in stating that there was no robbery during the summer of eighteen seventy two, the bank at Columbia, kentucky., having been raided april twenty ninth of that year.
7975_280076_000019_000002 Ray.
7975_280076_000020_000000 It was immediately following the Rock Island robbery at Adair, Iowa, that there first appeared a deliberate enlistment of some local papers in Missouri to connect us with this robbery.
7975_280084_000000_000001 THE NORTHFIELD RAID
7975_280084_000001_000000 While Pitts and I were waiting for Bob and Chadwell we scouted about, going to Madelia and as far as the eastern part of Cotton wood county, to familiarize ourselves with the country.
7975_280084_000001_000001 Finally, a few days later, the boys joined us, having bought their horses at Mankato.
7975_280084_000002_000000 We then divided into two parties and started for Northfield by somewhat different routes.
7975_280084_000002_000002 The hotel was full of lawyers, and they, with the judge and other court attendants, had a high old time that night.
7975_280084_000002_000003 Tuesday night we were at Cordova, a little village in Le Sueur county, and Wednesday night in Millersburg, eleven miles west of Northfield.
7975_280084_000002_000005 We reunited Thursday morning, september seventh, a little outside Northfield, west of the Cannon river.
7975_280084_000003_000000 We took a trip into town that forenoon, and I looked over the bank.
7975_280084_000003_000001 We had dinner at various places and then returned to the camp.
7975_280084_000003_000002 While we were planning the raid it was intended that I should be one of the party to go into the bank.
7975_280084_000004_000000 "What if they begin shooting at us?" some one suggested.
7975_280084_000005_000000 "Well," said Bob, "if Cap is so particular about the shooting, suppose we let him stay outside and take his chances."
7975_280084_000006_000002 There were no saddle horses in evidence, and we calculated that we would have a considerable advantage.
7975_280084_000007_000000 But between the time we broke camp and the time they reached the bridge the three who went ahead drank a quart of whisky, and there was the initial blunder at Northfield.
7975_280084_000009_000000 When we came up I told Miller to shut the bank door, which they had left open in their hurry.
7975_280084_000009_000001 I dismounted in the street, pretending to tighten my saddle girth.
7975_280084_000009_000002 j s Allen, whose hardware store was near, tried to go into the bank, but Miller ordered him away, and he ran around the corner, shouting:
7975_280084_000010_000000 "Get your guns, boys; they're robbing the bank."
7975_280084_000011_000003 I do not believe they killed any one, however.
7975_280084_000011_000004 I have always believed that the man Nicholas Gustavson, who was shot in the street, and who, it was said, did not go inside because he did not understand English, was hit by a glancing shot from Manning's or Wheeler's rifle.
7975_280084_000011_000005 If any of our party shot him it must have been Woods.
7975_280084_000012_000000 A man named Elias Stacy, armed with a shot gun, fired at Miller just as he was mounting his horse, filling Clell's face full of bird shot.
7975_280084_000012_000001 Manning took a shot at Pitts' horse, killing it, which crippled us badly. Meantime the street was getting uncomfortably hot.
7975_280084_000012_000002 Every time I saw any one with a bead on me I would drop off my horse and try to drive the shooter inside, but I could not see in every direction.
7975_280084_000012_000003 I called to the boys in the bank to come out, for I could not imagine what was keeping them so long.
7975_280084_000012_000004 With his second shot Manning wounded me in the thigh, and with his third he shot Chadwell through the heart.
7975_280084_000013_000000 At last the boys who had been in the bank came out.
7975_280084_000013_000001 Bob ran down the street toward Manning, who hurried into Lee and Hitchcock's store, hoping in that way to get a shot at Bob from behind.
7975_280084_000013_000002 Bob, however, did not see Wheeler, who was upstairs in the hotel behind him, and Wheeler's third shot shattered Bob's right elbow as he stood beneath the stairs.
7975_280084_000013_000004 Miller was lying in the street, but we thought him still alive.
7975_280084_000013_000005 I told Pitts to put him up with me, and I would pack him out, but when we lifted him I saw he was dead, and I told Pitts to lay him down again.
7975_280084_000013_000007 I stayed there pointing my pistol at any one who showed his head until Pitts had gone perhaps thirty or forty yards, and then, putting spurs to my horse, I galloped to where he was and took him up behind me.
7975_280084_000014_000000 "What kept you so long?" I asked Pitts.
7975_280084_000015_000000 Then he told me they had been drinking and had made a botch of it inside the bank.
7975_280084_000015_000001 Instead of carrying out the plan originally formed, seizing the cashier at his window and getting to the safe without interruption, they leaped right over the counter and scared Heywood at the very start.
7975_280084_000015_000002 As to the rest of the affair inside the bank I take the account of a Northfield narrator:
7975_280084_000016_000000 "With a flourish of his revolver one of the robbers pointed to Joseph l Heywood, head bookkeeper, who was acting as cashier in the absence of that official, and asked:"
7975_280084_000017_000000 " 'Are you the cashier?' "
7975_280084_000018_000000 " 'No,' " replied Heywood, and the same question was put to a e Bunker, teller, and Frank j Wilcox, assistant bookkeeper, each of whom made the same reply.
7975_280084_000019_000000 " 'You are the cashier,' said the robber, turning upon Heywood, who was sitting at the cashier's desk.
7975_280084_000019_000001 'Open that safe-quick or I'll blow your head off.' "
7975_280084_000020_000000 "Pitts then ran to the vault and stepped inside, whereupon Heywood followed him and tried to shut him in."
7975_280084_000025_000000 Bunker tried to get a pistol that lay near him, but Pitts saw his movement and beat him to it.
7975_280084_000027_000001 The shutters were closed, and this caused Bunker an instant's delay that was almost fatal.
7975_280084_000027_000002 Pitts chased him with a bullet.
7975_280084_000027_000003 The first one missed him, but the second went through his right shoulder.
7975_280084_000028_000000 As the men left the bank Heywood clambered to his feet and Pitts, in his liquor, shot him through the head, inflicting the wound that killed him.
7975_280084_000029_000000 We had no time to wreck the telegraph office, and the alarm was soon sent throughout the country.
7975_280084_000030_000000 governor John s Pillsbury first offered one thousand dollars reward for the arrest of the six who had escaped, and this he changed afterward to one thousand dollars for each of them, dead or alive.
7975_280085_000000_000001 A CHASE TO THE DEATH
7975_280085_000001_000000 A little way out of Northfield we met a farmer and borrowed one of his horses for Pitts to ride.
7975_280085_000001_000001 We passed Dundas on the run, before the news of the robbery had reached there, and at Millersburg, too, we were in advance of the news, but at Shieldsville we were behind it.
7975_280085_000001_000002 Here a squad of men, who, we afterwards learned, were from Faribault, had left their guns outside a house.
7975_280085_000001_000003 We did not permit them to get their weapons until we had watered our horses and got a fresh start.
7975_280085_000001_000004 They overtook us about four miles west of Shieldsville, and shots were exchanged without effect on either side.
7975_280085_000001_000005 A spent bullet did hit me on the "crazy bone," and as I was leading Bob's horse it caused a little excitement for a minute, but that was all.
7975_280085_000002_000000 We were in a strange country.
7975_280085_000002_000001 On the prairie our maps were all right, but when we got into the big woods and among the lakes we were practically lost.
7975_280085_000004_000000 That night it started to rain, and we wore out our horses.
7975_280085_000004_000002 Saturday morning we left our horses and started through on foot, hiding that day on an island in a swamp.
7975_280085_000004_000004 Meantime our pursuers were watching for horsemen, not finding our abandoned horses, it seems, until Monday or Tuesday.
7975_280085_000005_000000 Bob's shattered elbow was requiring frequent attention, and that night we made only nine miles, and Monday, Monday night and Tuesday we spent in a deserted farm house close to Mankato.
7975_280085_000005_000001 That day a man named Dunning discovered us and we took him prisoner.
7975_280085_000005_000002 Some of the boys wanted to kill him, on the theory that "dead men tell no tales," while others urged binding him and leaving him in the woods.
7975_280085_000005_000003 Finally we administered to him an oath not to betray our whereabouts until we had time to make our escape, and he agreed not to.
7975_280085_000005_000004 No sooner, however, was he released than he made posthaste into Mankato to announce our presence, and in a few minutes another posse was looking for us.
7975_280085_000006_000000 Suspecting, however, that he would do so, we were soon on the move, and that night we evaded the guard at the Blue Earth river bridge, and about midnight made our way through Mankato.
7975_280085_000006_000001 The whistle on the oil mill blew, and we feared that it was a signal that had been agreed upon to alarm the town in case we were observed, but we were not molested.
7975_280085_000007_000000 Howard and Woods, who had favored killing Dunning, and who felt we were losing valuable time because of Bob's wound, left us that night and went west.
7975_280085_000009_000000 We had been living on scant rations, corn, watermelon and other vegetables principally, but in spite of this Bob's arm was mending somewhat.
7975_280085_000009_000001 He had to sleep with it pillowed on my breast, Jim being also crippled with a wound in his shoulder, and we could not get much sleep.
7975_280085_000009_000002 The wound in my thigh was troubling me and I had to walk with a cane I cut in the brush. One place we got a chicken and cooked it, only to be interrupted before we could have our feast, having to make a quick dash for cover.
7975_280085_000010_000000 At every stopping place we left marks of blood from our wounds, and could have been easily trailed had not the pursuers been led in the track of our recent companions.
7975_280085_000011_000001 Vought, of the Flanders house, a damaging suggestion which proved the ultimate undoing of our party.
7975_280085_000011_000005 w w Murphy, col
7975_280085_000011_000007 They came up with us as we were fording a small slough, and unable to ford it with their horses, they were delayed somewhat by having to go around it.
7975_280085_000011_000008 But they soon after got close enough so that one of them broke my walking stick with a shot.
7975_280085_000011_000010 We were at bay on the open prairie, surrounded by a picket line of forty men, some of whom would fight.
7975_280085_000011_000011 Not prepared to stand for our last fight against such odds on the open field, we fell back into the Watonwan river bottoms and took refuge in some bushes.
7975_280085_000012_000000 We were prepared to wait as long as they would, but they were not of the waiting kind.
7975_280085_000012_000002 Six stepped to the front, Sheriff Glispin, col
7975_280085_000012_000003 t l Vought, b m Rice, g a Bradford, c a Pomeroy and s j Severson.
7975_280085_000013_000000 Forming in line four paces apart, he ordered them to advance rapidly and concentrate the fire of the whole line the instant the robbers were discovered.
7975_280085_000014_000000 Meanwhile we were planning, too.
7975_280085_000015_000000 "Pitts," I said, "if you want to go out and surrender, go on."
7975_280085_000016_000000 "I'll not go," he replied, game to the last.
7975_280085_000016_000001 "I can die as well as you can."
7975_280085_000017_000000 "Make for the horses," I said.
7975_280085_000017_000001 "Every man for himself.
7975_280085_000017_000002 There is no use stopping to pick up a comrade here, for we can't get him through the line. Just charge them and make it if we can."
7975_280085_000020_000000 "Coward!"
7975_280085_000021_000000 One of the fellows in the outer line, not brave enough himself to join the volunteers who had come in to beat us out, was not disposed to believe in the surrender, and had his gun levelled on Bob in spite of the handkerchief which was waving as a flag of truce.
7975_280085_000022_000000 Sheriff Glispin, of Watonwan county, who was taking Bob's pistol from him, was also shouting to the fellow:
7975_280085_000023_000000 "Don't shoot him or I'll shoot you."
7975_280085_000024_000000 All of us but Bob had gone down at the first fire.
7975_280085_000025_000000 A bullet had pierced Bob's right lung, but he was the only one left on his feet.
7975_280085_000025_000001 His right arm useless, and his pistol empty, he had no choice.
7975_280085_000026_000000 "I surrender," he had shouted.
7975_280085_000026_000001 "They're all down but me.
7975_280085_000026_000002 Come on.
7975_280085_000026_000003 I'll not shoot."
7975_280085_000027_000000 And Sheriff Glispin's order not to shoot was the beginning of the protectorate that Minnesota people established over us.
7975_280085_000028_000002 We were taken to his hotel and a guard posted.
7975_280085_000029_000000 Then came the talk of mob vengeance we had heard so often in Missouri.
7975_280085_000029_000002 Sheriff Glispin swore we would never be mobbed as long as we were his prisoners.
7975_280085_000031_000000 "If they do come, and I weaken," he said, "you can have your pistols."
7975_280085_000032_000000 But the only mob that came was the mob of sightseers, reporters and detectives.
8131_117016_000001_000000 Chapter four
8131_117016_000002_000000 CAPTAIN MURDOCH
8131_117016_000003_000002 At one time, there had been a small dome and a tiny city devoted to the rocket field.
8131_117016_000003_000003 But Marsport had flourished enough to kill it off.
8131_117016_000004_000000 Bruce Gordon was trapped; he couldn't break his job with the police-if he did, he'd be brought back as a criminal.
8131_117016_000004_000001 Some of Mars' laws dated from the time when law enforcement had been hampered by lack of men, rather than by the type of men.
8131_117016_000005_000000 The Stonewall gang numbered perhaps five hundred.
8131_117016_000005_000002 Between times, they picked up what they could by mugging and theft, with a reasonable amount of murder thrown in at a modest price.
8131_117016_000006_000001 And police had been taken off the beats there after it grew unsafe even for men in pairs to patrol the area.
8131_117016_000007_000000 The shopkeepers, and some of the less unfortunate people there, had protested loud enough to reach clear back to Earth.
8131_117016_000007_000002 Captain Murdoch was an unknown factor, and now was asking for more men.
8131_117016_000007_000003 The pressure was enough to get them for him.
8131_117016_000008_000000 Gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out, mixed with a vague relief.
8131_117016_000009_000000 "You're going to be busy," Murdoch announced shortly in the dilapidated building that had been hastily converted to a precinct house.
8131_117016_000009_000001 "Damn it, you're men, not sharks.
8131_117016_000009_000002 I've got a free hand, and we're going to run this the way we would on Earth.
8131_117016_000009_000003 Your job is to protect the citizens here-and that means everyone not breaking the laws-whether you feel like it or not.
8131_117016_000009_000004 No graft.
8131_117016_000009_000005 The first man making a shakedown will get the same treatment we're going to use on the Stonewall boys.
8131_117016_000009_000006 You'll get double pay here, and you can live on it!"
8131_117016_000010_000000 He opened up a box on his desk and pulled out six heavy wooden sticks, each thirty inches long and nearly two inches in diameter.
8131_117016_000010_000001 There was a shaped grip on each, with a thong of leather to hold it over the wrist.
8131_117016_000011_000000 He picked out five of the men, including Gordon "You five will come with me.
8131_117016_000011_000003 Okay, men, let's go."
8131_117016_000012_000000 Bruce Gordon grinned slowly as he swung the stick, and Murdoch's eyes fell on him.
8131_117016_000012_000001 "Earth cop!"
8131_117016_000013_000000 "Two years," Gordon admitted.
8131_117016_000014_000000 "Then you should be ashamed to be in this mess.
8131_117016_000014_000001 But whatever your reasons, you'll be useful.
8131_117016_000014_000002 Take those two and give them some lessons, while I do the same with these."
8131_117016_000015_000000 For a second, Gordon cursed himself.
8131_117016_000015_000001 Murdoch had fixed it so he'd be a squad leader, and that meant he'd be unable to step out of line.
8131_117016_000016_000000 He began wondering about Security, then.
8131_117016_000016_000001 Nobody had tried to get in touch with him.
8131_117016_000017_000000 There was a crude lighting system here, put up by the citizens.
8131_117016_000017_000001 At the front of each building, a dim phosphor bulb glowed; when darkness fell, they would have nothing else to see by.
8131_117016_000018_000000 Murdoch bunched them together.
8131_117016_000018_000001 "A good clubbing beats hanging," he told them.
8131_117016_000018_000003 Go in for business, and don't stop just because the other guy quits.
8131_117016_000019_000000 Moving in two groups of threes, at opposite sides of the street, they began their beat.
8131_117016_000019_000001 They were covering an area of six blocks one way, and two the other.
8131_117016_000020_000001 Two of the Stonewall boys were working over a tall man in a newer airsuit.
8131_117016_000020_000002 As the police swung around, one of the thugs casually ripped the airsuit open.
8131_117016_000021_000000 A thin screech like a whistle came from Murdoch's Marspeaker, and the captain went forward, with Gordon at his heels.
8131_117016_000021_000001 The hoodlums tossed the man aside easily, and let out a yell.
8131_117016_000021_000002 From the buildings around, an assortment of toughs came at the double, swinging knives, picks, and bludgeons.
8131_117016_000022_000000 There was no chance to save the citizen, who was dying from lack of air. Gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands. It was light enough for speed, but heavy enough to break bones where it hit.
8131_117016_000022_000001 A skilled man could knock a knife, or even a heavy club, out of another's hand with a single flick of the wrist.
8131_117016_000022_000002 And he'd had practice.
8131_117016_000023_000000 He saw Murdoch's club dart in and take out two of the gang, one on the forward swing, one on the recover.
8131_117016_000023_000001 Gordon's eyes popped at that.
8131_117016_000023_000002 The man was totally unlike a Martian captain, and a knot of homesickness for Earth ran through his stomach.
8131_117016_000024_000000 He swallowed the sentiment; his own club was moving now.
8131_117016_000024_000001 Standing beside Murdoch, they were moving forward.
8131_117016_000024_000002 The other four cops had come in reluctantly.
8131_117016_000025_000000 "Knock them out and kick them down!" Murdoch yelled.
8131_117016_000025_000001 "And don't let them get away!"
8131_117016_000026_000001 He brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys.
8131_117016_000027_000000 It was soon over.
8131_117016_000027_000001 They rounded up the men of the gang, and one of the cops started off.
8131_117016_000027_000002 Murdoch called, "Where are you going?"
8131_117016_000028_000000 "To find a phone and call the wagon."
8131_117016_000029_000001 "Line them up."
8131_117016_000030_000000 When the hoods came to, they found themselves helpless, and facing police with clubs.
8131_117016_000030_000002 If they fought back, the pugnaciousness was knocked out of them at once.
8131_117016_000031_000000 Murdoch indicated one who stood with his shoulders shaking and tears running down his cheeks.
8131_117016_000031_000002 Names."
8131_117016_000032_000000 Gordon found a section away from the others.
8131_117016_000032_000001 "I want the name of every man in the gang you can remember," he told the man.
8131_117016_000033_000001 "Colonel, they'd kill me! I don't know."
8131_117016_000034_000000 His screams were almost worse than the beating but names began to come. Gordon took them down, and then returned with the man to the others.
8131_117016_000035_000000 Murdoch took his nod as evidence enough, and turned to the wretched toughs.
8131_117016_000035_000001 "He squealed," he announced.
8131_117016_000035_000002 "If he should turn up dead, I'll know you boys are responsible, and I'll find you.
8131_117016_000035_000003 Now get out of this district, or get honest jobs!
8131_117016_000035_000004 Because every time one of my men sees one of you, this will happen again.
8131_117016_000035_000005 And you can pass the word along that the Stonewall gang is dead!"
8131_117016_000036_000001 Gordon nodded.
8131_117016_000036_000003 Suppose the whole gang jumps us at once?"
8131_117016_000037_000000 Murdoch shrugged.
8131_117016_000037_000002 The old book I got the idea from didn't mention that."
8131_117016_000038_000002 Murdoch sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six, and then a third.
8131_117016_000038_000003 After that, the watchers began to melt away.
8131_117016_000039_000000 "We'd better shift to another territory," Murdoch decided.
8131_117016_000039_000001 Gordon realized that the gang had figured that concentrating the police here meant other territories would be safe.
8131_117016_000040_000000 Two more groups were given the treatment.
8131_117016_000040_000002 He was a sick looking spectacle.
8131_117016_000041_000000 Murdoch nodded.
8131_117016_000041_000001 "Object lesson!"
8131_117016_000042_000000 The one good thing about the captain, Gordon decided, was that he believed in doing his own dirtiest work.
8131_117016_000042_000001 When he was finished, he turned to two of the other captives.
8131_117016_000043_000000 "Get a stretcher, and take him wherever he belongs," he ordered.
8131_117016_000043_000001 "I'm leaving you two able to walk for that.
8131_117016_000044_000000 The squad went in, tired and sore; all had taken a severe beating in the brawls.
8131_117016_000044_000001 But there was little grumbling.
8131_117016_000044_000002 Gordon saw grudging admiration in their eyes for Murdoch, who had taken more punishment than they had.
8131_117016_000045_000000 Gordon rode back in the official car with Murdoch and both were silent most of the way.
8131_117016_000045_000001 But the captain stirred finally, sighing.
8131_117016_000045_000002 "Poor devils!"
8131_117016_000046_000000 Gordon jerked up in surprise.
8131_117016_000046_000001 "The gang?"
8131_117016_000047_000001 We're covered, Gordon.
8131_117016_000047_000002 But the Stonewall gang is backing Wayne.
8131_117016_000047_000003 He's let me come in because he figures it will get him more votes.
8131_117016_000047_000004 But afterwards, he'll have me out; and then the boys with me will be marks for the gang when it comes back.
8131_117016_000047_000005 Besides, it'll show on the books that they didn't kick into his fund.
8131_117016_000047_000006 I can always go back to Earth, and I'll try to take you along.
8131_117016_000047_000007 But it's going to be tough on them."
8131_117016_000048_000000 Bruce Gordon grimaced.
8131_117016_000048_000001 "I've got a yellow ticket, from Security."
8131_117016_000049_000000 Murdoch blinked.
8131_117016_000050_000000 They rode on further in silence, until Gordon broke the ice to ease the tension.
8131_117016_000050_000001 He found himself liking the other.
8131_117016_000051_000000 "What makes you think Wayne will be re-elected?
8131_117016_000051_000001 Nobody wants him, except a gang of crooks and those in power."
8131_117016_000052_000000 Murdoch grinned bitterly.
8131_117016_000052_000001 "Ever see a Martian election?
8131_117016_000052_000002 No, you're a firster.
8131_117016_000052_000003 He can't lose!
8131_117016_000052_000004 And then hell is going to pop, and this whole planet may be blown wide open!"
8131_117016_000053_000000 It fitted with the dire predictions of Security, and with the spying Gordon was going to do-according to them.
8131_117016_000054_000000 He discussed it with Mother Corey, who agreed that Wayne would be re-elected.
8131_117016_000055_000000 "Can't lose," the old man said.
8131_117016_000056_000000 "He'll win," Mother Corey repeated.
8131_117016_000056_000001 "And you'll turn honest all over, now you're in uniform.
8131_117016_000056_000002 Take me, cobber.
8131_117016_000056_000004 Cost 'em more, but they'd be respectable.
8131_117016_000056_000005 Only now I'm respectable myself, they don't look so good.
8131_117016_000056_000006 But this honesty stuff, it's like dope.
8131_117016_000056_000007 You start out on a little, and you have to go all the way."
8131_117016_000057_000000 "It didn't affect Honest Izzy," Gordon pointed out.
8131_117016_000058_000000 "Nope.
8131_117016_000058_000001 Because Izzy is always honest, according to how he sees it.
8131_117016_000058_000002 But you got Earth ideas of the stuff, like I had once.
8131_117016_000058_000003 Too bad." He sighed ponderously.
8131_117016_000059_000000 The week moved on.
8131_117016_000059_000001 The groups grew more experienced, and Murdoch was training a new squad every night.
8131_117016_000059_000002 Gordon's own squad was equipped with shields now, and they were doing better.
8131_117016_000059_000003 The number of muggings and holdups in the section was going down.
8131_117016_000061_000000 After that, they began to go hunting for the members of the gang.
8131_117016_000061_000001 They had the names of nearly all of them, and some pretty good ideas of their hide outs.
8131_117016_000062_000000 It wasn't exactly legal; but nothing was, here.
8131_117016_000062_000001 If a doctor's job was to prevent illness, instead of merely curing it, then why shouldn't it be a policeman's job to prevent crime?
8131_117016_000062_000002 Here, that was best done by wiping out the Stonewall gang to the last member.
8131_117016_000063_000000 This could lead to abuses, as he'd seen on Earth.
8131_117016_000064_000000 The gang had begun to break up, but the nucleus would be the last to go. The police had orders to beat any member on sight, now.
8131_117016_000064_000001 Citizens were appearing on the streets at night for the first time in years.
8131_117017_000001_000000 RECALL
8131_117017_000002_000000 It was night outside, and the phosphor bulbs at the corners glowed dimly, giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house.
8131_117017_000002_000001 Bruce Gordon reached the outskirts of the miserable business section, noticing that a couple of the shops were still open.
8131_117017_000002_000002 It had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun went down.
8131_117017_000002_000003 And the slow, doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that Haley's system was working.
8131_117017_000002_000004 Gordon nodded to a couple, and they grinned faintly at him. Damn it, Mars could be cleaned up....
8131_117017_000003_000000 He grinned at himself, then something needled at his mind, until he swung back.
8131_117017_000004_000001 Gordon moved forward quickly, until he could make out the thin scar showing through the make-up over the man's eyes.
8131_117017_000004_000002 He'd been right-this was O'Neill, head of the Stonewall gang.
8131_117017_000005_000000 Gordon hit the signal switch, and the Marspeaker let out a shrill whistle.
8131_117017_000005_000001 O'Neill had turned to run, and then seemed to think better of it.
8131_117017_000005_000002 His hand darted down to his belt, just as Gordon reached him.
8131_117017_000006_000000 The heavy locust stick met the man's wrist before the weapon was half drawn-another gun!
8131_117017_000006_000001 Guns suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere. The gun dropped from O'Neill's hand as the wrist snapped, and the Stonewall chief let out a high pitched cry of pain.
8131_117017_000006_000002 Then another cop came around a corner at a run.
8131_117017_000007_000000 "You can't do it to me!
8131_117017_000007_000001 I'm reformed; I'm going straight!
8131_117017_000007_000002 You damned cops can't...." O'Neill was blubbering.
8131_117017_000008_000000 The other cop had yanked out O'Neill's wallet, and now tossed it to Gordon.
8131_117017_000008_000002 The cops had been passing them on the hope of finding one of the leaders.
8131_117017_000009_000000 Some turned away as Gordon and the other cop went to work, but most of them weren't squeamish.
8131_117017_000009_000001 When it was over, the two picked up their whimpering captive.
8131_117017_000009_000002 Gordon pocketed the revolver with his free hand. "Walk, O'Neill!" he ordered.
8131_117017_000009_000003 "Your legs are still whole.
8131_117017_000009_000004 Use them!"
8131_117017_000010_000000 The man staggered between them, whimpering at each step.
8131_117017_000010_000001 If any members of the gang were around, they made no attempt to rescue him.
8131_117017_000011_000000 Jenkins, the other cop, had been holding the wallet.
8131_117017_000011_000001 Now he held it out toward Gordon.
8131_117017_000011_000004 Fifty fifty?"
8131_117017_000012_000000 "Turn it in to Murdoch," Gordon said, and then cursed himself.
8131_117017_000012_000001 There must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet.
8131_117017_000013_000000 The captain's face had been buried in a pile of papers, but now Murdoch came around to stare at the gang leader.
8131_117017_000013_000001 He inspected the forged work papers, and jerked his thumb toward one of the hastily built cells where a doctor would look O'Neill over-eventually.
8131_117017_000013_000002 When Gordon and Jenkins came back, Murdoch tossed the money to them.
8131_117017_000013_000003 "Split it.
8131_117017_000013_000004 You guys earned it by keeping your hands off it.
8131_117017_000013_000006 I never saw it. Gordon, you've got a visitor!"
8131_117017_000014_000000 His voice was bitter, but he made no opening for them to question him as he picked up the papers and began going through them again.
8131_117017_000014_000001 Gordon went down the passage to the end of the hall, in the direction Murdoch had indicated.
8131_117017_000014_000002 Waiting for him was the lean, cynical little figure of Honest Izzy, complete with uniform and sergeant's stripes.
8131_117017_000015_000000 "Hi, gov'nor," the little man greeted him.
8131_117017_000015_000001 "Long time no see.
8131_117017_000015_000002 With you out here and me busy nights doing a bit of convoy work on the side, we might as well not both live at Mother's."
8131_117017_000016_000000 Bruce Gordon nodded, grinning in spite of himself.
8131_117017_000016_000001 "Convoy duty, Izzy? Or dope running?"
8131_117017_000017_000000 "Whatever comes to hand, gov'nor.
8131_117017_000017_000001 The Force pays for my time during the day, and I figure my time's my own at night.
8131_117017_000017_000002 Of course, if I ever catch myself doing anything shady during the day, I'll have to turn myself in. But it ain't likely." He grinned in satisfaction.
8131_117017_000018_000000 "Like this social call?" Gordon asked him.
8131_117017_000019_000000 The little man shook his head, his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober.
8131_117017_000019_000001 "Nope.
8131_117017_000019_000002 I've been meaning to see you, so I volunteered to run out some red tape for your captain.
8131_117017_000019_000003 You owe me some bills, gov'nor. Eleven hundred fifty credits.
8131_117017_000019_000005 A thousand, interest at ten per cent a week, standard.
8131_117017_000019_000006 Right?"
8131_117017_000020_000000 Gordon had heard of the friendly interest charged on the side here, but he shook his head.
8131_117017_000020_000001 "Wrong, Izzy.
8131_117017_000020_000002 If they want to collect that dratted pledge of theirs, let them put me where I can make it.
8131_117017_000020_000003 There's no graft out here."
8131_117017_000021_000000 "Huh?" Izzy turned it over, and shook his head.
8131_117017_000021_000001 Finally he shrugged. "Don't matter, gov'nor.
8131_117017_000021_000002 Nothing about that in the pledge, and when you sign something, you gotta pay it.
8131_117017_000022_000000 "All right," Gordon admitted.
8131_117017_000022_000001 He was suddenly in no mood to quibble with Izzy's personal code.
8131_117017_000022_000002 "So you paid it.
8131_117017_000023_000000 For a second, Izzy's face went blank; then he chuckled.
8131_117017_000023_000001 "Jet me!
8131_117017_000023_000002 You're right, gov'nor.
8131_117017_000023_000003 I sure asked for that one.
8131_117017_000023_000004 Okay; I'm bloody well suckered, so forget it."
8131_117017_000024_000000 Gordon shrugged and gave up.
8131_117017_000024_000001 He pulled out the bills and handed them over.
8131_117017_000024_000002 "Thanks, Izzy."
8131_117017_000025_000000 "Thanks, yourself." The kid pocketed the money cheerfully, nodding.
8131_117017_000025_000001 "Buy you a beer.
8131_117017_000025_000002 Anyhow, you won't miss it.
8131_117017_000025_000003 I came out to tell you I got the sweetest beat in Marsport-over a dozen gambling joints on it-and I need a right gee to work it with me.
8131_117017_000025_000004 So you're it!"
8131_117017_000026_000000 For a moment, Gordon wondered what Izzy had done to earn that beat, but he could guess.
8131_117017_000026_000001 The little guy knew Mars as few others did, apparently, from all sides.
8131_117017_000026_000002 And if any of the other cops had private rackets of their own, Izzy was undoubtedly the man to find it out, and use the information.
8131_117017_000026_000003 With a beat such as that, even going halves, and with all the graft to the upper brackets, he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months.
8131_117017_000027_000000 But he shook his head.
8131_117017_000027_000001 "I'm assigned here, Izzy, at least for another week, until after elections...."
8131_117017_000028_000001 The captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped onto the bench.
8131_117017_000028_000002 "Go on, accept, damn it.
8131_117017_000028_000003 You're not assigned here any more.
8131_117017_000028_000004 None of us are.
8131_117017_000028_000006 I thought I had full responsibility to Earth, but he's got me.
8131_117017_000028_000007 Wearing their uniform makes me a temporary citizen!
8131_117017_000029_000001 Then he stopped and looked back.
8131_117017_000029_000002 "One thing, though, I've still got enough authority to make you a sergeant.
8131_117017_000029_000003 It's been a pleasure working with you, Sergeant Gordon!"
8131_117029_000000_000000 Chapter seventeen
8131_117029_000001_000000 SECURITY PAYOFF
8131_117029_000002_000000 It was three days before Bruce Gordon made up his mind to hunt up Security; another four days passed after they had sent him back to wait until they received orders from Headquarters for him.
8131_117029_000002_000001 There was a man coming from Earth on a second ship who would see him.
8131_117029_000002_000002 They gave him a chauffeur back to the Chicken Coop, and politely indicated that it would be better if he stayed within reach.
8131_117029_000003_000000 The dome had been down a full week when he watched the last of Randolph's equipment packed onto a truck and hauled away.
8131_117029_000003_000002 Rusty was busy opening his bar, and the others were all busy.
8131_117029_000003_000003 Only Gordon and Sheila were left.
8131_117029_000004_000000 He heard her coming down the old stairs, and ducked out through the private exit, snapping his helmet in place as he went through the seal. She must have sensed his desire to be left alone, since she made no attempt to follow.
8131_117029_000004_000001 She'd asked no questions and hadn't even tried to convince him that he'd be sent back to Earth now.
8131_117029_000005_000000 He muttered to himself as he headed over the rubble toward the previously domed section.
8131_117029_000006_000000 Out at the spaceport, ships were dropping down from Deimos with the supplies that had been held up so long, and a long line of trucks went snaking by.
8131_117029_000006_000001 Credit had been established again, and the businesses were open.
8131_117029_000007_000000 For the time being, the hoods and punks were having a tough time of it, with working papers demanded as constant identification.
8131_117029_000007_000001 And while it lasted, at least, Marsport was beginning to have its face lifted.
8131_117029_000007_000002 Wrecks were being broken up, with salvageable material used for newer homes. Gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles, individual dwellings built like the dome, but opaque for privacy.
8131_117029_000009_000000 They had been lucky.
8131_117029_000009_000001 The dome had exploded outwards, with only bits of it falling back; and the buildings had come through the outward explosion of the pressure with little damage.
8131_117029_000009_000002 Gordon grinned wryly. Schulberg's volunteers were official, now.
8131_117029_000009_000004 The old charter for Marsport from North America was dead, and the whole city was now under Security charter, like the rest of the planet.
8131_117029_000010_000000 Gordon moved automatically toward the Seventh Ward.
8131_117029_000010_000001 Fats' Place was still open, though the crooked tables had been removed.
8131_117029_000010_000002 Gordon dropped to a stool, slipping off his helmet.
8131_117029_000010_000003 He reached automatically for the glass of ether needled beer.
8131_117029_000010_000004 This time, it even tasted good to him.
8131_117029_000011_000000 "On the house, copper," Fats' voice said.
8131_117029_000011_000001 The man dropped to another stool, rolling dice casually between his thumbs.
8131_117029_000011_000002 "And bring out a steak, there!
8131_117029_000011_000003 You look as if you could stand it-and Fats don't forget old friends!"
8131_117029_000012_000001 "Maybe you should have got me that night, Fats."
8131_117029_000013_000001 "That's Mars." He rolled the dice out, then picked them up again.
8131_117029_000013_000002 "Guess I'll have to stick to selling meals, mostly-for a while, at least.
8131_117029_000013_000004 Thought you'd be in the chips!"
8131_117029_000014_000000 "That's Mars," Gordon echoed the other's comment.
8131_117029_000014_000001 "Why don't you pull off the planet, Fats?
8131_117029_000014_000002 You could go back to Earth, I'd guess."
8131_117029_000015_000000 The other nodded.
8131_117029_000015_000001 "Yeah.
8131_117029_000015_000002 I went back, about ten years ago.
8131_117029_000015_000003 Spent four weeks down there.
8131_117029_000015_000005 Guess a man gets used to anything ...
8131_117029_000015_000006 Hell, maybe I can hire some bums to sit around and whoop it up when the ships come in, and bill this as a real old Martian den of sin!
8131_117029_000016_000000 Gordon grinned wryly; Fats would probably make more than ever.
8131_117029_000017_000000 He finished the meal, accepted a pack of the Earth cigarettes that sold at a luxury price here, and went out into the thin air of Mars.
8131_117029_000017_000001 It was almost good to get out into the filth of the slums, and be heading back to the still standing monument of the old Chicken Coop.
8131_117029_000017_000002 He headed for the private entrance out of habit, and then shrugged as he realized it was a needless precaution now.
8131_117029_000017_000003 He moved up the front steps and through the battered seal.
8131_117029_000018_000000 Then he stopped.
8131_117029_000018_000001 Security had finally gotten around to him, it seemed. Inside the hallway, the Security man who'd first sent him to Mars was waiting.
8131_117029_000019_000000 There was a grin on the other's face.
8131_117029_000019_000001 "Hello, Gordon.
8131_117029_000019_000002 Finally got our orders for you.
8131_117029_000019_000003 It's Mercury!"
8131_117029_000020_000000 Bruce Gordon nodded slowly.
8131_117029_000020_000001 "All right.
8131_117029_000021_000001 He grinned again.
8131_117029_000021_000002 "We know about Murdoch, and we know where Trench is-but he's a good citizen now, so he can stay there.
8131_117029_000021_000003 We're not throwing the book at you, Bruce.
8131_117029_000021_000004 Damn it, we sent you here to get results, and you got them.
8131_117029_000021_000005 We sent twenty others the same way-and they failed.
8131_117029_000022_000000 "I wonder if it's worth it," Gordon said slowly.
8131_117029_000023_000000 The other shook his head.
8131_117029_000023_000001 "We can't know in our lifetime.
8131_117029_000023_000002 All we can do is to hope.
8131_117029_000023_000003 We'll probably get this Mother Corey and Isaacs elected properly; and for a while, things will improve.
8131_117029_000023_000004 But there'll be pushers as long as weak men turn to drugs, and graft as long as voters allow the thing to get out of their hands.
8131_117029_000023_000005 Let's say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit, and given them a chance to do better.
8131_117029_000023_000006 It's up to them to take it or lose it."
8131_117029_000024_000000 "So I get sent to Mercury?"
8131_117029_000025_000000 "You can't stay here.
8131_117029_000025_000001 They'll find out too much eventually." He paused, estimating Gordon.
8131_117029_000025_000003 You're a fighter.
8131_117029_000025_000004 And there's hell brewing on Mercury-worse than here.
8131_117029_000025_000005 We've got permission to send you there, if you'll go.
8131_117029_000025_000006 With a yellow ticket, again-but without any razzle dazzle this time.
8131_117029_000026_000000 Gordon sighed.
8131_117029_000026_000001 "All right.
8131_117029_000026_000002 But I wish you'd tell my wife sometime that-well, that I didn't just run out on her.
8131_117029_000026_000003 She's had bad luck with men."
8131_117029_000027_000000 "She already knows," the Security man said.
8131_117029_000027_000002 And I've paid her the pay we owe you from the time you began using your badge.
8131_117029_000027_000003 She's out shopping!"
8131_117029_000028_000000 The car pulled up to the waiting rocket, and the Security man helped him up the steps with a perfunctory wish for good luck.
8131_117029_000028_000001 Then Bruce Gordon stopped as great arms surrounded him.
8131_117029_000029_000001 But his old eyes were glinting.
8131_117029_000029_000002 "Did you think we'd let you go without seeing you off, cobber?" he asked.
8131_117029_000029_000005 Izzy, you tell him."
8131_117029_000030_000000 He grabbed Gordon's hand and waddled down the landing plank.
8131_117029_000030_000001 Izzy shook his head.
8131_117029_000031_000000 "I can't say it, either, gov'nor-but some day, I'm going to have one of those badges myself.
8131_117029_000031_000001 Like I always said, honesty sure pays, even if it kills you.
8131_117029_000031_000002 Here!"
8188_269288_000001_000000 FRESHERS.
8188_269288_000002_000002 They joined the tennis, racquets, and boating clubs; Eileen and Marjorie, having submitted to the necessary test, were made full blown members of the latter club immediately.
8188_269288_000002_000003 Leslie had to take a few swimming lessons before she could do so.
8188_269288_000004_000001 As she intended to aim at a first, or, at least, second class, her range of study was very wide; and German, French, and Italian literature had to be more or less understood in order to give her a thorough and complete grip of her subject.
8188_269288_000004_000002 But Leslie was a healthy girl; she had been well trained, she had plenty of self possession, and an abundance of strong common sense.
8188_269288_000004_000003 She had no idea of allowing herself to break down.
8188_269288_000004_000004 In order to avoid such a catastrophe, she divided her hours carefully, allowing a certain amount for recreation and a certain amount also for the guiding of her wayward companion, to whom, as the days went on, she became really attached.
8188_269288_000007_000000 "What do you mean?" replied Leslie.
8188_269288_000008_000000 "Why, you will be parting from me, you know.
8188_269288_000008_000001 I won't be the constant worry and plague of your life.
8188_269288_000008_000003 In any case, you are quite certain to wish for another room, and to get it also next term.
8188_269288_000008_000004 If I do remain, therefore, I shall be plagued with some terrible student of the Florrie Smart or Jane Heriot style.
8188_269288_000010_000001 "But," she added abruptly, "you speak of something which must not take place.
8188_269288_000010_000002 I must pass in honors; if I don't I shall die."
8188_269288_000011_000002 I find these modern languages so very stiff."
8188_269288_000012_000000 "What are you studying now?" asked Annie.
8188_269288_000013_000000 "I have to take German literature from fifteen hundred to the death of Goethe," said Leslie.
8188_269288_000013_000001 "The course is enormous, and I am sometimes almost in despair."
8188_269288_000014_000000 "But you have only just come; you can easily manage, and in any case, even if you fail----"
8188_269288_000015_000000 "I do not mean to fail any more than you do," replied Leslie.
8188_269288_000016_000000 Annie did not smile.
8188_269288_000016_000001 Her queer red brown eyes with their distended pupils gazed straight before her.
8188_269288_000017_000000 "It can never mean the same to you," she said at last in a solemn voice, and then she looked down again at her book, pushed her hands through her red locks, and resumed her contemplation of the problem which lay before her.
8188_269288_000018_000000 A few moments later there came a tap at the door.
8188_269288_000018_000001 Annie did not hear it. Leslie opened the door.
8188_269288_000019_000000 Jane Heriot stood without.
8188_269288_000020_000000 "These letters have just come for you and Annie Colchester," she said: "and, as I was coming upstairs, I thought I would leave them with you."
8188_269288_000021_000000 Leslie thanked her and eagerly grasped the little parcel.
8188_269288_000021_000002 Her eyes shone with pleasure at the anticipation of the delightful time she would have reveling in the home news; the other letter was directed to Annie Colchester.
8188_269288_000023_000001 "I am so glad that you have got one at last----"
8188_269288_000025_000000 "It has come," she cried: "at last I have news."
8188_269288_000026_000000 Her face grew suddenly white as death.
8188_269288_000028_000001 "I have been starving, or, rather, I have been thirsting.
8188_269288_000029_000000 "Well, read it in peace," said Leslie.
8188_269288_000029_000002 I am truly glad it has come."
8188_269288_000030_000000 Leslie seated herself with her back to her companion and opened her own letters.
8188_269288_000030_000001 After a time she looked round.
8188_269288_000031_000000 "Have you had bad news?" said Leslie.
8188_269288_000032_000001 She crushed the letter up tight, thrust it into her pocket, and said abruptly, "What is the hour?"
8188_269288_000034_000001 I must go into the grounds; the air is stifling."
8188_269288_000036_000000 "I shall go-I know a way.
8188_269288_000036_000001 Don't say a word.
8188_269288_000036_000002 I'll be back presently."
8188_269288_000038_000000 Leslie stood and thought about her for a moment or two; but then her own correspondence absorbed her, and she did not notice when eleven and even twelve struck.
8188_269288_000039_000000 Just after midnight she rose with a sigh to prepare for bed.
8188_269288_000039_000001 She looked round the room.
8188_269288_000039_000002 There was no sign of Annie Colchester.
8188_269288_000040_000002 Oh! now I remember; she got a letter which upset her very much and went out.
8188_269288_000040_000003 Dear, dear! where can she be?"
8188_269288_000041_000001 She ventured to call Annie's name softly; there was no reply.
8188_269288_000041_000002 She shut the window.
8188_269288_000042_000000 "There is nothing for it but for me to go and look for her," she said to herself.
8188_269288_000042_000002 Poor girl, she spoke of it as cold water to the thirsty; she looked when I saw her last as if it had half killed her.
8188_269288_000042_000003 What can she be doing out by herself?
8188_269288_000042_000004 Yes, I must find her without delay."
8188_269288_000043_000001 Annie's eyes were very bright, her cheeks were no longer pale, and there was a brilliant color in them. She did not take the least notice of Leslie; but, going into the room, shut the door.
8188_269288_000043_000002 Leslie opened it and followed her.
8188_269288_000044_000000 "Dear me, Annie!" she said, "I was quite frightened about you."
8188_269288_000045_000000 "Don't begin," said Annie.
8188_269288_000046_000000 "Don't begin!
8188_269288_000046_000001 What do you mean?"
8188_269288_000047_000000 "I mean that I don't want you to begin to ask questions.
8188_269288_000047_000001 I am going to get into bed, and to remain perfectly quiet, and you are not to ask me one question about anything.
8188_269288_000047_000002 I want to sleep.
8188_269288_000047_000003 I walked up and down as fast as ever I could outside in order to make myself sleepy.
8188_269288_000047_000005 I shall go off to sleep-that is all I care for."
8188_269288_000048_000000 "But your letter, dear?"
8188_269288_000049_000001 "I am not going to confide in you; so don't think it.
8188_269288_000049_000002 I only want to get into bed and to sleep."
8188_269288_000050_000000 Leslie did not venture to say any more.
8188_269288_000050_000001 She lit the little spirit lamp, put on the milk to boil, and prepared the cocoa as usual.
8188_269288_000051_000000 "Now, drink this at once," she said in a voice of authority, "if you really wish to sleep."
8188_269288_000053_000000 "Drink that?" she said.
8188_269288_000053_000001 "Do you want to kill me?
8188_269288_000053_000002 Don't talk any more.
8188_269288_000053_000003 I am sleepy; I shall sleep."
8188_269288_000054_000000 She got into bed as she spoke, and wrapped the clothes tightly round her.
8188_269288_000055_000000 "Oh, do turn off the electric light," she said again.
8188_269288_000055_000001 "Can't you manage with a candle, just for once?"
8188_269288_000057_000000 She turned off the light, and lit a candle, which she put behind her screen, then prepared to get into bed.
8188_269288_000058_000000 Annie's manner was very mysterious.
8188_269288_000058_000001 There was no doubt that she had got a shock; but of what nature Leslie could not in the least make out. There was no help for it, however.
8188_269290_000000_000001 Say nothing about me, please.
8188_269290_000001_000002 Oh, Annie, I know you are dreadfully unhappy about something, and I wish I could comfort you.
8188_269290_000001_000003 Do-do let me."
8188_269290_000003_000000 "You are ill," said Leslie.
8188_269290_000003_000001 "I ought not to leave you.
8188_269290_000003_000003 Do let me go and tell Miss Frere.
8188_269290_000005_000000 "How dare you interfere?" she said, her eyes flashing.
8188_269290_000005_000001 "You are to go, and say nothing about me.
8188_269290_000005_000003 I am longing for you to leave the room.
8188_269290_000005_000006 I want to be alone-go!"
8188_269290_000006_000000 "I know you don't quite mean what you say," said Leslie; "but of course if you really wish me----"
8188_269290_000007_000001 "You fret me beyond endurance.
8188_269290_000007_000002 Since you came I feel myself tied and bound.
8188_269290_000007_000003 Yes; you annoy me more than words can tell."
8188_269290_000008_000000 Leslie walked to her own side of the room.
8188_269290_000009_000001 "She does not know what she is saying.
8188_269290_000015_000000 "I took it out," said Leslie.
8188_269290_000016_000000 "Took it out!
8188_269290_000016_000001 And why, may I ask?
8188_269290_000016_000002 Have the goodness to find it and put it back."
8188_269290_000017_000001 You know on occasions you are absent minded, and one half of this room is mine when all's said and done.
8188_269290_000017_000002 I pay for it, and I have a right to it."
8188_269290_000019_000000 "Oh, I won't lock you out," she said; "but I must have the key.
8188_269290_000019_000001 Please find it before you go."
8188_269290_000020_000000 Jane Heriot's voice was heard in the passage.
8188_269290_000021_000000 "If you two are ready," she called out, "we may as well start."
8188_269290_000022_000000 "Coming in a moment, Jane," answered Leslie.
8188_269290_000023_000000 "What can this mean?" she said to herself.
8188_269290_000024_000000 Jane came up.
8188_269290_000025_000000 "What is it, Leslie?" she said; "you look as if something was worrying you."
8188_269290_000026_000000 "Something is," replied Leslie, "but I don't know that I ought to tell tales out of school."
8188_269290_000029_000000 "Oh, my dear," said Jane, "if you begin to fret about the oddities of the college you will never know a moment's peace.
8188_269290_000030_000000 "Oh, I shall never do that," replied Leslie.
8188_269290_000030_000001 "I don't want," she added, "to get into any set: but I do wish to be kind to Belle, for I think she has good points in her.
8188_269290_000030_000002 You see, all the girls except Eileen and Marjorie laugh at her, and that seems to me to make her worse."
8188_269290_000031_000001 "But there, you are one of the 'unco good,' I am afraid."
8188_269290_000032_000000 "Please don't call me that," said Leslie, tears now visiting her pretty eyes.
8188_269290_000033_000004 They say too that you are exceedingly clever, and yet you have no jealousies and no smallnesses in you.
8188_269290_000033_000005 You are a universal favorite; I envy you your popularity."
8188_269290_000034_000001 "Some day, Jane, you must see her.
8188_269290_000035_000000 "I shall be only too delighted," cried Jane.
8188_269290_000035_000001 "But now, Leslie, what is the trouble?
8188_269290_000035_000002 that is, if you care to confide in me."
8188_269290_000036_000000 "I believe poor Annie is dreadfully unhappy."
8188_269290_000037_000001 Miss Lauderdale will be very angry with anyone who does not attend."
8188_269290_000038_000001 She refuses to come."
8188_269290_000039_000000 Jane stood still and faced Leslie.
8188_269290_000040_000000 "Refuses to come?" she cried.
8188_269290_000041_000002 I felt her hand too, and it was very hot.
8188_269290_000041_000003 I am sure she is ill.
8188_269290_000041_000004 She works too hard, and she---- But there, I don't know that I ought to say any more."
8188_269290_000042_000000 "Don't say any more," cried Jane.
8188_269290_000042_000001 "I'll go back and speak to her.
8188_269290_000042_000002 It is my duty to save her from getting into hopeless disgrace."
8188_269290_000043_000000 "I'll wait for you here," said Leslie.
8188_269290_000044_000001 She turned back, ran down the corridor, and knocked at Annie's door.
8188_269290_000045_000001 "I am Jane Heriot; I want to speak to you at once.
8188_269290_000045_000002 Let me in."
8188_269290_000046_000000 There was no reply.
8188_269290_000047_000000 Jane rattled the handle impatiently.
8188_269290_000048_000001 You will get into a most awful scrape if you don't.
8188_269290_000048_000002 Do come, Annie; don't be such a goose.
8188_269290_000049_000000 Still there was no response.
8188_269290_000049_000001 Jane stooped, and applied her eye to the keyhole, but she could see nothing within.
8188_269290_000049_000002 In despair she came back and joined Leslie.
8188_269290_000050_000000 "She seems to have turned both deaf and dumb, and I can do nothing with her," she answered.
8188_269290_000050_000001 "It is just possible that she may have gone down the back stairs, and be already in the hall."
8188_269290_000052_000000 But Marjorie and Eileen had already departed, and Leslie and Jane found themselves among the last students to arrive at the great East Hall.
8188_269290_000053_000001 One by one the many students filed in and took their places.
8188_269290_000053_000002 Then a roll call was gone through by one of the tutors; the only absentee was Annie Colchester.
8188_269290_000053_000004 Miss Lauderdale stepped forward, and began to address the students.
8188_269290_000054_000000 "The physical part of your training, and also the mental part, are abundantly supplied in this great house of learning," she continued; "but the spiritual part, it seems to me, ought now to be strengthened.
8188_269290_000055_000000 "Hear, hear! and once again, hear!" suddenly said the sharp voice of Belle Acheson.
8188_269290_000055_000001 She uttered her strange remark standing up.
8188_269290_000055_000002 Marjorie and Eileen were close to her.
8188_269290_000057_000001 Miss Lauderdale, after a pause, during which her kind eyes were fixed on Belle's excited face, spoke:
8188_269290_000058_000000 "I will talk with you, Belle Acheson, presently," she said.
8188_269290_000058_000005 I will then more fully declare my plans, and show the girls who wish to join our league a programme which I hope they will approve of."
8188_269290_000059_000000 Miss Lauderdale said a great deal more.
8188_269290_000059_000001 All her words were uttered with great eloquence and much feeling.
8188_269290_000060_000000 "'Am I my brother's keeper?' you ask," she continued.
8188_269290_000060_000001 "God answers to each of you, 'You are.' The world says, 'No, I am not,' but God says, 'Yes, you are.' All men are your brothers.
8188_269290_000060_000002 For all who sin, all who suffer, you are to a certain extent responsible.
8188_269290_000060_000004 You are responsible for him, and some day you will be asked what you have done with your responsibility. If you leave the world without having fulfilled that terrible and yet grand obligation, you will through all eternity feel the loss of what you might have gained."
8188_269290_000061_000000 Finally the principal sat down amid loud cheering.
8188_269290_000061_000001 Most of the girls were enthusiastic over the new scheme; and Marjorie and Eileen in particular felt their hearts glowing and their eyes sparkling.
8188_269290_000062_000000 After the address the girls themselves were encouraged to speak, and a very animated discussion followed.
8188_269290_000062_000001 When it was over, folding doors were thrown back, and all the students were invited into the large saloon which Miss Lauderdale reserved for very rare and special occasions.
8188_269290_000062_000002 Here they were supplied with light refreshments, and presently Miss Lauderdale herself went to the organ at the end of the room, and played some splendid music.
8188_269290_000062_000003 She was a musician of rare power, and Leslie listened with her heart in her eyes.
8188_269290_000063_000000 It was past ten o'clock when she left the hall.
8188_269290_000065_000000 "I don't think she is quite well," replied Leslie.
8188_269290_000066_000000 "I see by your face, Miss Gilroy, that you are distressed about something.
8188_269290_000067_000000 "I am afraid I am," replied Leslie, distress now in her tone.
8188_269290_000068_000001 "I must see her myself early in the morning, and I am quite sure that nothing will satisfy Miss Lauderdale except a very ample apology and a full explanation of the reason why she absented herself.
8188_269290_000068_000002 She has committed a very grave act of disobedience.
8188_269290_000068_000004 Excuses make no difference.
8188_269290_000068_000005 The girl who breaks the rules has to be punished.
8188_274364_000007_000000 The articles of impeachment against Strafford are twenty eight in number; and regard his conduct, as president of the council of York, as deputy or lieutenant of Ireland, and as counsellor or commander in England.
8188_274364_000009_000000 In the government of Ireland, his administration had been equally promotive of his master's interest, and that of the subjects committed to his care.
8188_274364_000015_000001 But discretionary authority during that age was usually exercised even in England.
8188_274364_000015_000002 In Ireland, it was still more requisite, among a rude people, not yet thoroughly subdued, averse to the religion and manners of their conquerors, ready on all occasions to relapse into rebellion and disorder.
8188_274364_000016_000001 No imputation of rapacity could justly lie against his administration.
8188_274364_000016_000002 Some instances of imperious expressions, and even actions, may be met with.
8188_274364_000016_000003 The case of Lord Mountnorris, of all those which were collected with so much industry, is the most flagrant and the least excusable.
8188_274364_000024_000000 "Where has this species of guilt lain so long concealed?" said Strafford in conclusion.
8188_274364_000026_000000 "Let us not, to our own destruction, awake those sleeping lions, by rattling up a company of old records which have lain for so many ages by the wall, forgotten and neglected.
8188_274364_000028_000000 "Impose not, my lords, difficulties insurmountable upon ministers of state, nor disable them from serving with cheerfulness their king and country.
8188_274364_000030_000000 "And now, my lords, I thank God, I have been by his blessing sufficiently instructed in the extreme vanity of all temporary enjoyments, compared to the importance of our eternal duration.
8188_274364_000031_000001 The accusation and defence lasted eighteen days.
8188_274364_000031_000003 Strafford was obliged to speak with deference and reserve towards his most inveterate enemies, the commons, the Scottish nation, and the Irish parliament.
8188_274364_000035_000002 The question before the council was, "Offensive or defensive war with the Scots." The king proposes this difficulty, "But how can I undertake offensive war, if I have no more money?"
8188_274364_000035_000003 The answer ascribed to Strafford was in these words: "Borrow of the city a hundred thousand pounds: go on vigorously to levy ship money.
8188_274364_000035_000004 Your majesty having tried the affections of your people, you are absolved and loose from all rules of government, and may do what power will admit.
8188_274364_000035_000005 Your majesty, having tried all ways, shall be acquitted before God and man.
8224_274384_000000_000001 He rode before a portmanteau, and called himself Ashburnham's servant.
8224_274384_000001_000000 The Scottish generals and commissioners affected great surprise on the appearance of the king; and though they paid him all the exterior respect due to his dignity, they instantly set a guard upon him, under color of protection, and made him in reality a prisoner.
8224_274384_000001_000001 They informed the English parliament of this unexpected incident, and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king.
8224_274384_000005_000001 He was particularly attentive to the behavior of their preachers, on whom all depended.
8224_274384_000005_000005 Have we eaten at all of the king's cost?
8224_274384_000005_000006 or hath he given us any gift?
8224_274384_000005_000009 Another preacher, after reproaching him to his face with his misgovernment, ordered this psalm to be sung:--
8224_274384_000006_000000 "Why dost thou, tyrant, boast thyself, Thy wicked deeds to praise?"
8224_274384_000010_000002 The Scottish generals would enter into no confidence with him; and still treated him with distant ceremony and feigned respect.
8224_274384_000014_000000 They required him to issue orders to Oxford and to all his other garrisons, commanding their surrender to the parliament; and the king, sensible that their resistance was to very little purpose, willingly complied.
8224_274384_000015_000001 Montrose also, after having experienced still more variety of good and bad fortune, threw down his arms, and retired out of the kingdom.
8224_274384_000016_000000 The marquis of Worcester, a man past eighty four, was the last in England that submitted to the authority of the parliament.
8224_274384_000016_000001 He defended Raglan Castle to extremity; and opened not its gates till the middle of August.
8224_274384_000017_000000 The parliament and the Scots laid their proposals before the king.
8224_274384_000017_000001 They were such as a captive, entirely at mercy, could expect from the most inexorable victor.
8224_274384_000017_000002 Yet were they little worse than what were insisted on before the battle of Naseby.
8224_274384_000018_000001 He requested a personal treaty with the parliament.
8224_274384_000022_000000 What the parliament was most intent upon, was not their treaty with the king, to whom they paid little regard, but that with the Scots.
8224_274384_000022_000001 Two important points remained to be settled with that nation: their delivery of the king, and the estimation of their arrears.
8224_274384_000026_000002 And though the contributions which they had levied, as well as the price of their living at free quarters, must be deducted, yet still the sum which they insisted on was very considerable.
8224_274384_000028_000000 Great pains were taken by the Scots (and the English complied with their pretended delicacy) to make this estimation and payment of arrears appear a quite different transaction from that for the delivery of the king's person: but common sense requires that they should be regarded as one and the same.
8224_274384_000029_000000 Thus the Scottish nation underwent, and still undergo, (for such grievous stains are not easily wiped off,) the reproach of selling their king and betraying their prince for money.
8224_274384_000030_000000 The infamy of this bargain had such an influence on the Scottish parliament, that they once voted that the king should be protected, and his liberty insisted on.
8224_274384_000031_000001 The English commissioners, who, some days after, came to take him under their custody, were admitted to kiss his hands; and he received them with the same grace and cheerfulness as if they had travelled on no other errand than to pay court to him.
8224_274384_000032_000001 On his journey, the whole country flocked to behold him, moved partly by curiosity, partly by compassion and affection.
8224_274384_000036_000001 The parliament, though earnestly applied to by the king, refused to allow his chaplains to attend him, because they had not taken the covenant.
8224_274384_000037_000000 During the time that the king remained in the Scottish army at Newcastle, died the earl of Essex, the discarded, but still powerful and popular general of the parliament.
8224_274384_000037_000001 His death, in this conjuncture, was a public misfortune.
8224_274384_000037_000002 Fully sensible of the excesses to which affairs had been carried, and of the worse consequences which were still to be apprehended, he had resolved to conciliate a peace, and to remedy, as far as possible, all those ills to which, from mistake rather than any bad intentions, he had himself so much contributed.
8230_279154_000001_000001 MEMORY
8230_279154_000002_000000 Memory, which we are to consider to day, introduces us to knowledge in one of its forms.
8230_279154_000002_000001 The analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture, and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise.
8230_279154_000003_000001 I shall discuss this question in later lectures.
8230_279154_000003_000002 In the present lecture I shall attempt the analysis of memory knowledge, both as an introduction to the problem of knowledge in general, and because memory, in some form, is presupposed in almost all other knowledge.
8230_279154_000003_000003 Sensation, we decided, is not a form of knowledge.
8230_279154_000003_000004 It might, however, have been expected that we should begin our discussion of knowledge with PERCEPTION, i e with that integral experience of things in the environment, out of which sensation is extracted by psychological analysis.
8230_279154_000003_000005 What is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates-images and expectations of their usual correlates-all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation.
8230_279154_000003_000006 The FACT of past experience is essential in producing this filling out of sensation, but not the RECOLLECTION of past experience.
8230_279154_000003_000007 The non sensational elements in perception can be wholly explained as the result of habit, produced by frequent correlations.
8230_279154_000003_000009 The purely psychological problems which it raises are not very difficult, though they have sometimes been rendered artificially obscure by unwillingness to admit the fallibility of the non sensational elements of perception.
8230_279154_000004_000000 One reason for treating memory at this early stage is that it seems to be involved in the fact that images are recognized as "copies" of past sensible experience.
8230_279154_000004_000002 Such modifications of Hume's principle, however, do not affect the problem which I wish to present for your consideration, namely: Why do we believe that images are, sometimes or always, approximately or exactly, copies of sensations?
8230_279154_000004_000003 What sort of evidence is there?
8230_279154_000004_000004 And what sort of evidence is logically possible?
8230_279154_000004_000005 The difficulty of this question arises through the fact that the sensation which an image is supposed to copy is in the past when the image exists, and can therefore only be known by memory, while, on the other hand, memory of past sensations seems only possible by means of present images.
8230_279154_000004_000006 How, then, are we to find any way of comparing the present image and the past sensation?
8230_279154_000004_000008 To deal with this problem, we must have a theory of memory.
8230_279154_000004_000009 In this way the whole status of images as "copies" is bound up with the analysis of memory.
8230_279154_000006_000001 In the first place, everything constituting a memory belief is happening now, not in that past time to which the belief is said to refer.
8230_279154_000006_000002 It is not logically necessary to the existence of a memory belief that the event remembered should have occurred, or even that the past should have existed at all.
8230_279154_000006_000003 There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that "remembered" a wholly unreal past.
8230_279154_000006_000004 There is no logically necessary connection between events at different times; therefore nothing that is happening now or will happen in the future can disprove the hypothesis that the world began five minutes ago.
8230_279154_000006_000005 Hence the occurrences which are CALLED knowledge of the past are logically independent of the past; they are wholly analysable into present contents, which might, theoretically, be just what they are even if no past had existed.
8230_279154_000007_000000 I am not suggesting that the non existence of the past should be entertained as a serious hypothesis.
8230_279154_000007_000001 Like all sceptical hypotheses, it is logically tenable, but uninteresting.
8230_279154_000007_000002 All that I am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember.
8230_279154_000008_000000 In the second place, images without beliefs are insufficient to constitute memory; and habits are still more insufficient.
8230_279154_000008_000001 The behaviourist, who attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour, has to trust his memory in making the record.
8230_279154_000008_000002 "Habit" is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times; if the behaviourist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit, that can only be because he trusts his memory, when it assures him that there have been other times.
8230_279154_000008_000003 And the same applies to images.
8230_279154_000008_000004 If we are to know as it is supposed we do-that images are "copies," accurate or inaccurate, of past events, something more than the mere occurrence of images must go to constitute this knowledge.
8230_279154_000008_000005 For their mere occurrence, by itself, would not suggest any connection with anything that had happened before.
8230_279154_000009_000001 How is it possible to know that a memory image is an imperfect copy, without having a more accurate copy by which to replace it?
8230_279154_000009_000002 This would SEEM to suggest that we have a way of knowing the past which is independent of images, by means of which we can criticize image memories.
8230_279154_000009_000003 But I do not think such an inference is warranted.
8230_279154_000010_000000 What results, formally, from our knowledge of the past through images of which we recognize the inaccuracy, is that such images must have two characteristics by which we can arrange them in two series, of which one corresponds to the more or less remote period in the past to which they refer, and the other to our greater or less confidence in their accuracy.
8230_279154_000010_000001 We will take the second of these points first.
8230_279154_000011_000000 Our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must, in fundamental cases, be based upon a characteristic of the image itself, since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image.
8230_279154_000011_000001 It might be suggested that vagueness is the required characteristic, but I do not think this is the case.
8230_279154_000011_000002 We sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague, which yet we do not trust-for example, under the influence of fatigue we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly, but horribly distorted.
8230_279154_000011_000003 In such a case we distrust our image in spite of its being unusually clear.
8230_279154_000011_000004 I think the characteristic by which we distinguish the images we trust is the feeling of FAMILIARITY that accompanies them.
8230_279154_000011_000005 Some images, like some sensations, feel very familiar, while others feel strange.
8230_279154_000011_000006 Familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees.
8230_279154_000011_000007 In an image of a well-known face, for example, some parts may feel more familiar than others; when this happens, we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts.
8230_279154_000011_000008 I think it is by this means that we become critical of images, not by some imageless memory with which we compare them.
8230_279154_000011_000009 I shall return to the consideration of familiarity shortly.
8230_279154_000012_000000 I come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past.
8230_279154_000012_000001 They must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past.
8230_279154_000012_000002 That is to say if we suppose that A is the event remembered, B the remembering, and t the interval of time between A and B, there must be some characteristic of B which is capable of degrees, and which, in accurately dated memories, varies as t varies. It may increase as t increases, or diminish as t increases.
8230_279154_000012_000003 The question which of these occurs is not of any importance for the theoretic serviceability of the characteristic in question.
8230_279154_000013_000001 There may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of "pastness," especially where immediate memory is concerned.
8230_279154_000013_000002 But apart from this, there are other marks.
8230_279154_000013_000003 One of these is context.
8230_279154_000013_000004 A recent memory has, usually, more context than a more distant one.
8230_279154_000014_000000 There is, of course, a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present, and knowing the time order of two remembered events.
8230_279154_000014_000001 Very often our knowledge of the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present is inferred from its temporal relations to other remembered events.
8230_279154_000014_000002 It would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present, but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events.
8230_279154_000015_000000 We may say, then, that images are regarded by us as more or less accurate copies of past occurrences because they come to us with two sorts of feelings: (one) Those that may be called feelings of familiarity; (two) those that may be collected together as feelings giving a sense of pastness.
8230_279154_000017_000000 If we had retained the "subject" or "act" in knowledge, the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple.
8230_279154_000017_000002 But the rejection of the subject renders some more complicated theory necessary.
8230_279154_000017_000003 Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling, or related to, what is remembered.
8230_279154_000017_000004 And it is difficult to find any ground, except a pragmatic one, for supposing that memory is not sheer delusion, if, as seems to be the case, there is not, apart from memory, any way of ascertaining that there really was a past occurrence having the required relation to our present remembering.
8230_279154_000018_000000 Some points may be taken as fixed, and such as any theory of memory must arrive at.
8230_279154_000018_000002 The study of any topic is like the continued observation of an object which is approaching us along a road: what is certain to begin with is the quite vague knowledge that there is SOME object on the road.
8230_279154_000018_000004 In like manner, in the study of memory, the certainties with which you begin are very vague, and the more precise propositions at which you try to arrive are less certain than the hazy data from which you set out.
8230_279154_000018_000005 Nevertheless, in spite of the risk of error, precision is the goal at which we must aim.
8230_279154_000019_000000 The first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past.
8230_279154_000019_000002 Nevertheless, whatever a sceptic might urge in theory, we cannot practically doubt that we got up this morning, that we did various things yesterday, that a great war has been taking place, and so on.
8230_279154_000019_000003 How far our knowledge of the past is due to memory, and how far to other sources, is of course a matter to be investigated, but there can be no doubt that memory forms an indispensable part of our knowledge of the past.
8230_279154_000020_000000 The second datum is that we certainly have more capacity for knowing the past than for knowing the future.
8230_279154_000021_000000 A third point, perhaps not quite so certain as our previous two, is that the truth of memory cannot be wholly practical, as pragmatists wish all truth to be.
8230_279154_000021_000001 It seems clear that some of the things I remember are trivial and without any visible importance for the future, but that my memory is true (or false) in virtue of a past event, not in virtue of any future consequences of my belief.
8230_279154_000021_000002 The definition of truth as the correspondence between beliefs and facts seems peculiarly evident in the case of memory, as against not only the pragmatist definition but also the idealist definition by means of coherence.
8230_279154_000021_000003 These considerations, however, are taking us away from psychology, to which we must now return.
8230_279154_000022_000000 It is important not to confuse the two forms of memory which Bergson distinguishes in the second chapter of his "Matter and Memory," namely the sort that consists of habit, and the sort that consists of independent recollection.
8230_279154_000022_000001 He gives the instance of learning a lesson by heart: when I know it by heart I am said to "remember" it, but this merely means that I have acquired certain habits; on the other hand, my recollection of (say) the second time I read the lesson while I was learning it is the recollection of a unique event, which occurred only once.
8230_279154_000022_000002 The recollection of a unique event cannot, so Bergson contends, be wholly constituted by habit, and is in fact something radically different from the memory which is habit.
8230_279154_000022_000003 The recollection alone is true memory.
8230_279154_000022_000004 This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory.
8230_279154_000022_000005 But it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory. Habit is a very intrusive feature of our mental life, and is often present where at first sight it seems not to be.
8230_279154_000022_000006 There is, for example, a habit of remembering a unique event.
8230_279154_000022_000007 When we have once described the event, the words we have used easily become habitual.
8230_279154_000022_000008 We may even have used words to describe it to ourselves while it was happening; in that case, the habit of these words may fulfil the function of Bergson's true memory, while in reality it is nothing but habit memory.
8230_279154_000022_000009 A gramophone, by the help of suitable records, might relate to us the incidents of its past; and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe.
8230_279154_000023_000001 I can set to work now to remember things I never remembered before, such as what I had to eat for breakfast this morning, and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this.
8230_279154_000023_000002 It is this sort of occurrence that constitutes the essence of memory Until we have analysed what happens in such a case as this, we have not succeeded in understanding memory.
8230_279154_000024_000000 The sort of memory with which we are here concerned is the sort which is a form of knowledge.
8230_279154_000024_000002 The fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it.
8230_279154_000024_000003 Similarly, the performances of animals in getting out of cages or mazes to which they are accustomed do not prove that they remember having been in the same situation before. Arguments in favour of (for example) memory in plants are only arguments in favour of habit memory, not of knowledge memory.
8230_279154_000024_000005 Semon's two books, mentioned in an earlier lecture, do not touch knowledge memory at all closely.
8230_279154_000024_000006 They give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds, but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences, which is what constitutes knowledge memory.
8230_279154_000024_000007 It is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge.
8230_279154_000024_000008 I shall speak of it as "true" memory, to distinguish it from mere habit acquired through past experience.
8230_279154_000024_000009 Before considering true memory, it will be well to consider two things which are on the way towards memory, namely the feeling of familiarity and recognition.
8230_279154_000026_000000 We often feel that something in our sensible environment is familiar, without having any definite recollection of previous occasions on which we have seen it.
8230_279154_000026_000001 We have this feeling normally in places where we have often been before-at home, or in well-known streets.
8230_279154_000026_000002 Most people and animals find it essential to their happiness to spend a good deal of their time in familiar surroundings, which are especially comforting when any danger threatens.
8230_279154_000026_000003 The feeling of familiarity has all sorts of degrees, down to the stage where we dimly feel that we have seen a person before.
8230_279154_000026_000004 It is by no means always reliable; almost everybody has at some time experienced the well-known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time.
8230_279154_000026_000005 There are occasions when familiarity does not attach itself to any definite object, when there is merely a vague feeling that SOMETHING is familiar.
8230_279154_000026_000008 The judgment that what is familiar has been experienced before is a product of reflection, and is no part of the feeling of familiarity, such as a horse may be supposed to have when he returns to his stable.
8230_279154_000026_000009 Thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone.
8230_279154_000027_000000 A further stage is RECOGNITION.
8230_279154_000027_000001 This may be taken in two senses, the first when a thing not merely feels familiar, but we know it is such and such.
8230_279154_000027_000002 We recognize our friend Jones, we know cats and dogs when we see them, and so on.
8230_279154_000027_000003 Here we have a definite influence of past experience, but not necessarily any actual knowledge of the past.
8230_279154_000027_000004 When we see a cat, we know it is a cat because of previous cats we have seen, but we do not, as a rule, recollect at the moment any particular occasion when we have seen a cat.
8230_279154_000027_000005 Recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association: the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word "cat," or with an auditory image of purring, or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment.
8230_279154_000027_000006 We are, of course, in fact able to judge, when we recognize an object, that we have seen it before, but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense, and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word.
8230_279154_000028_000001 This knowledge is memory in one sense, though in another it is not.
8230_279154_000028_000002 It does not involve a definite memory of a definite past event, but only the knowledge that something happening now is similar to something that happened before.
8230_279154_000028_000003 It differs from the sense of familiarity by being cognitive; it is a belief or judgment, which the sense of familiarity is not.
8230_279154_000028_000004 I do not wish to undertake the analysis of belief at present, since it will be the subject of the twelfth lecture; for the present I merely wish to emphasize the fact that recognition, in our second sense, consists in a belief, which we may express approximately in the words: "This has existed before."
8230_279154_000029_000001 To begin with, it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as "I have seen this before" than as "this has existed before." We recognize a thing (it may be urged) as having been in our experience before, whatever that may mean; we do not recognize it as merely having been in the world before.
8230_279154_000029_000002 I am not sure that there is anything substantial in this point.
8230_279154_000029_000003 The definition of "my experience" is difficult; broadly speaking, it is everything that is connected with what I am experiencing now by certain links, of which the various forms of memory are among the most important.
8230_279154_000029_000004 Thus, if I recognize a thing, the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which I recognize it forms part of "my experience" by DEFINITION: recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world.
8230_279154_000029_000005 Of course, the words "this has existed before" are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition, but that is unavoidable: words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive, and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition.
8280_266249_000001_000000 "There are some nice looking people on board," remarked mr Travilla, in an undertone, to his wife.
8280_266249_000002_000000 "Beside ourselves," added Cousin Ronald, laughing.
8280_266249_000003_000000 "Yes," she answered; "that little group yonder: a young minister and his wife and child, I suppose.
8280_266249_000004_000000 "Yes, mamma," chimed in the last named young gentleman, "he's a nice little boy.
8280_266249_000005_000000 Permission was given and the next moment the two stood close together each gazing admiringly into the other's face.
8280_266249_000007_000000 "Do you, son?" was the smiling rejoinder.
8280_266249_000007_000001 "He certainly looks like a very nice little boy.
8280_266249_000007_000002 Suppose you and he shake hands, Frank."
8280_266249_000008_000000 "Yes, sir," said the child, holding out a small, plump hand, "What's your name, little boy?"
8280_266249_000010_000000 "Yes, Frank Daly.
8280_266249_000010_000001 Don't you like this nice big boat?"
8280_266249_000011_000000 "Yes I do.
8280_266249_000012_000000 Frank looked inquiringly at his father.
8280_266249_000013_000000 "Yes, you may go if you wish," returned the latter, and the two started off hand in hand.
8280_266249_000014_000000 "Mamma, see!
8280_266249_000014_000001 isn't he a dear little boy?" asked Harold, leading his new friend up before her with an air of proud ownership.
8280_266249_000015_000000 "Yes indeed," she said, bending down to kiss Frank and stroke his hair.
8280_266249_000018_000000 "His name is Fank," said Harold.
8280_266249_000019_000000 Then Frank's papa came for him, saying the air was growing very cool, and it was time to go in.
8280_266249_000020_000000 Our friends were of the same opinion and all repaired to the ladies' saloon, where, through the children, they and the Dalys soon made acquaintance.
8280_266249_000021_000000 mr Daly was a minister going South for the winter for the sake of his own and his wife's health.
8280_266249_000022_000000 Cousin Ronald took Frank on his knee and asked, "What are you going to do, my little fellow, when you get to be a man."
8280_266249_000026_000000 "Rather comical, I think, my man.
8280_266249_000027_000000 "No sir: they don't laugh when papa says it."
8280_266249_000029_000000 mr Daly smiled.
8280_266249_000029_000001 "I never knew before," said he, "that my boy intended to follow my profession."
8280_266249_000030_000000 The ladies were weary, and retired to their state rooms shortly after tea, but the gentlemen sought the open air again and paced the deck for some time.
8280_266249_000031_000000 "Have a cigar, sir?" asked mr Lilburn, addressing mr Daly.
8280_266249_000032_000000 "Thank you, no; I don't smoke."
8280_266249_000033_000000 "Ah ha! um h'm!
8280_266249_000035_000000 "Ah ha! um h'm! ah ha!
8280_266249_000035_000001 But surely those were rare cases?"
8280_266249_000036_000000 "I think not very."
8280_266249_000039_000000 "Doubtless that is the case," remarked mr Dinsmore.
8280_266249_000040_000000 "I have never used the weed in any way," said Horace junior
8280_266249_000041_000000 "And I," remarked Travilla, "abandoned its use about the same time that Dinsmore did, and for the same reasons.
8280_266249_000041_000001 By the way, I met with a very strong article on the subject, lately, which I cut out and placed in my pocket book."
8280_266249_000042_000000 "Ah ha! um h'm! suppose you give us the benefit of it," suggested Lilburn good naturally, "I'm open to conviction."
8280_266249_000046_000000 "'The half dozen cigars which most smokers use a day, contain six or seven grains-enough, if concentrated and absorbed, to kill three men, and a pound of tobacco, according to its quality, contains from one quarter to one and a quarter ounces.
8280_266249_000047_000000 "'Is it strange, then that smokers and chewers have a thousand ailments? that German physicians attribute one half of the deaths among the young men of that country to tobacco?
8280_266249_000048_000000 "'One of the direct effects of tobacco is to weaken the heart.
8280_266249_000049_000000 "'And then such powerful acids produce intense irritation and thirst-thirst which water does not quench.
8280_266249_000049_000001 Hence a resort to cider and beer.
8280_266249_000049_000002 The more this thirst is fed, the more insatiate it becomes, and more fiery drink is needed.
8280_266249_000052_000001 that's strongly put," remarked mr Lilburn, reflectively.
8280_266249_000052_000002 "I'm afraid I'll have to give it up.
8280_266249_000058_000000 There was a pause broken by young Horace, who had been watching a group of men gathered about a table at the further end of the room.
8280_266249_000060_000000 The eyes of the whole party were at once turned in that direction.
8280_266249_000061_000001 some effort must be made!" and he started up as if with the intention of approaching the players.
8280_266249_000062_000000 "Stay a moment," exclaimed Lilburn in an undertone, and laying a detaining hand upon Travilla's arm, but with his gaze intently fixed upon the older gamester.
8280_266249_000062_000002 I saw him slip a card from his coat sleeve."
8280_266249_000063_000000 The words had scarcely passed his lips when a voice spoke apparently close at the villain's side.
8280_266249_000065_000000 "How dare you, sir?
8280_266249_000065_000001 who are you?" cried the rascal, starting up white with rage and turning to face his accuser.
8280_266249_000066_000000 "Who was it?
8280_266249_000068_000000 This time the voice seemed to come from a stateroom behind the gambler. Towering with rage, he rushed to the door and tried to open it.
8280_266249_000068_000001 Failing in that, he demanded admittance in loud angry tones, at the same time shaking the door violently, and kicking against it with a force that seemed likely to break in the panels.
8280_266249_000077_000000 "What does it mean?" cried one.
8280_266249_000078_000001 "Let's follow and see the fun."
8280_266249_000079_000000 "I wonder which of us it is!" remarked the first, looking hard at our party.
8280_266249_000080_000000 "I don't know, but come on.
8280_266249_000080_000001 That fellow Nick Ward, is a noted blackleg and ruffian: had his nose broken in a fight and is sensitive on the subject; was cheating of course."
8280_266249_000082_000000 "Where's that Dutch villain?" Ward was screaming, following up his question with a volley of oaths.
8280_266249_000085_000000 They heard him in silence, with a cool, phlegmatic indifference most exasperating to one in his present mood.
8280_266249_000089_000000 "Let me go!" yelled Ward, making a desperate effort to free his arms.
8280_266249_000093_000002 I'll have no fighting aboard."
8280_266249_000098_000000 Yet there was gambling again the second night, between Ward and several others of his profession.
8280_266249_000099_000000 They kept it up till after midnight.
8280_266249_000099_000001 Then mr Lilburn, waking from his first sleep, in a stateroom near by, thought he would break it up once more.
8280_266249_000101_000001 They bent eagerly over the board, each watching with feverish anxiety his companion's movements, each casting, now and again, a gloating eye upon the heap of gold and greenbacks that lay between them, and at times half stretching out his hand to clutch it.
8280_266249_000102_000000 A deep groan startled them and they sprang to their feet, pale and trembling with sudden terror, each holding his breath and straining his ear to catch a repetition of the dread sound.
8280_266249_000105_000000 "I tell you this is growing serious," whispered one in a shaking voice, his very lips white with fear.
8280_266249_000106_000000 "It came from under the table," gasped Ward, "look what's there."
8280_266249_000107_000000 "Look yourself."
8280_266249_000109_000000 There was nothing there.
8280_266249_000111_000000 "Oh, nonsense! what fools we are! of course somebody's ill in one of the state rooms." And they resumed their game for the second time.
8280_266249_000113_000000 It was the last game of cards for that trip.
8280_266249_000114_000000 The captain coming in shortly after the sudden flight of the gamblers, took charge of the money, and the next day restored it to the owners.
8280_266249_000115_000000 To Elsie's observant eyes it presently became evident that the Dalys were in very straitened circumstances.
8280_266249_000116_000000 She consulted with her husband, and the result was a warm invitation to the Dalys to spend the winter at Viamede, where they would have all the benefit of the mild climate, congenial society, use of the library, horses, etc, and be at no expense.
8280_266249_000117_000001 And how wonderfully he has answered our petitions.
8455_210777_000000_000000 CHAPTER nine.
8455_210777_000002_000002 I wept to think that a spirit of honesty should as yet have prevailed so little in the world.
8455_210777_000003_000000 I remained there alone for many hours, but I must acknowledge that before I left the chambers I had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light.
8455_210777_000003_000001 Had Eva Crasweller not been good looking, had Jack been still at college, had Sir Kennington Oval remained in England, had Mr Bunnit and the bar keeper not succeeded in stopping my carriage on the hill,--should I have succeeded in arranging for the final departure of my old friend?
8455_210777_000003_000003 And even had I succeeded in carrying my success so far as that, should I not have appeared a murderer to my fellow citizens had not his departure been followed in regular sequence by that of all others till it had come to my turn? Had Crasweller departed, and had the system then been stopped, should I not have appeared a murderer even to myself?
8455_210777_000003_000004 And what hope had there been, what reasonable expectation, that the system should have been allowed fair play?
8455_210777_000004_000006 Had the telegraph been invented in the days of ancient Rome, would the romans have accepted it, or have stoned Wheatstone? So thinking, I resolved that I was before my age, and that I must pay the allotted penalty.
8455_210777_000005_000002 There was Captain Battleax seated there, beautiful with a cocked hat, and an epaulet, and gold braid.
8455_210777_000005_000004 "Mr President," said he, "I am in command of her Majesty's gunboat, the john Bright, and I have come to pay my respects to the ladies."
8455_210777_000007_000000 "I have come to your shores, Mr President, with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world."
8455_210777_000008_000000 "Things were progressing, Captain Battleax, pretty well before this morning.
8455_210777_000008_000002 But, on the whole, we are a prosperous and well satisfied people."
8455_210777_000009_000000 "We are quite satisfied now, Captain Battleax," said my wife.
8455_210777_000010_000000 "Quite satisfied," said Eva.
8455_210777_000011_000000 "I am sure we are all delighted to hear the ladies speak in so pleasant a manner," said First Lieutenant Crosstrees, an officer with whom I have since become particularly intimate.
8455_210777_000012_000000 Then there was a little pause in the conversation, and I felt myself bound to say something as to the violent interruption to which I had this morning been subjected.
8455_210777_000012_000001 And yet that something must be playful in its nature.
8455_210777_000012_000002 I must by no means show in such company as was now present the strong feeling which pervaded my own mind.
8455_210777_000012_000003 "You will perceive, Captain Battleax, that there is a little difference of opinion between us all here as to the ceremony which was to have been accomplished this morning.
8455_210777_000012_000005 No doubt, in process of time the ladies will follow-"
8455_210777_000013_000000 "Their masters," said Mrs Neverbend.
8455_210777_000014_000000 This was a pretty little speech enough, and received the eager compliments of the officers of the john Bright.
8455_210777_000014_000001 "I did not mean," said Captain Battleax, "to touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this.
8455_210777_000014_000002 I am here only to pay my respects as a messenger from Great Britain to Britannula, to congratulate you all on your late victory at cricket, and to say how loud are the praises bestowed on Mr john Neverbend, junior, for his skill and gallantry.
8455_210777_000014_000004 We had received details of the whole affair by water telegram before the john Bright started.
8455_210777_000015_000000 Jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to Eva, and was now reduced to silence by his praises.
8455_210777_000018_000000 Then we began to think of the hospitality of the island, and the officers of the john Bright were asked to dine with us on the following day.
8455_210777_000018_000002 It seemed as though I were treated with almost royal honour.
8455_210777_000018_000003 This, I felt, was paid to me as being President of the republic, and I endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might befit the occasion; but I could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life.
8455_210777_000018_000006 Then there were three or four leading men of the community, with their wives, who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies.
8455_210777_000018_000010 I did once or twice during the festivity glance round at old Crasweller.
8455_210777_000018_000011 He was quiet, and I might almost say silent, during the whole evening; but I could see from the testimony of his altered countenance how strong is the passion for life that dwells in the human breast.
8455_210777_000019_000000 "Your promised bride seems to have it all her own way," said Captain Battleax to Jack, when at last the ladies had withdrawn.
8455_210777_000021_000000 Of what Mrs Neverbend had gone through in providing birds, beasts, and fishes, not to talk of tarts and jellies, for the dinner of that day, no one but myself can have any idea; but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorough success.
8455_210777_000022_000003 And immediately on his sitting down, there got up a gentleman to whom I had not been introduced before this day, and gave the health of Mrs Neverbend and the ladies of Britannula.
8455_210777_000022_000004 Now in spite of what the captain said, I undoubtedly had intended to make a speech.
8455_210777_000022_000005 When the President of the republic has his health drunk, it is, I conceive, his duty to do so.
8455_210777_000022_000007 At any rate, my eloquence was altogether stopped. The gentleman was named Sir Ferdinando Brown.
8455_210777_000022_000008 He was dressed in simple black, and was clearly not one of the ship's officers; but I could not but suspect at the moment that he was in some special measure concerned in the mission on which the gunboat had been sent. He sat on Mrs Neverbend's left hand, and did seem in some respect to be the chief man on that occasion.
8455_210777_000022_000009 However, he proposed Mrs Neverbend's health and the ladies, and the captain instantly called upon the band to play some favourite tune.
8455_210777_000022_000010 After that there was no attempt at speaking.
8455_210777_000022_000011 We sat with the officers some little time after dinner, and then went ashore.
8455_210777_000023_000001 A presentiment indeed!
8455_210777_000023_000002 How much of evil,--of real accomplished evil,--had there not occurred to me during the last few days!
8455_210777_000023_000003 Every hope for which I had lived, as I then told myself, had been brought to sudden extinction by the coming of these men to whom I had been so pleasant, and who, in their turn, had been so pleasant to me!
8455_210777_000023_000009 When this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to England, I would retire to a small farm which I possessed at the farthest side of the island, and there in seclusion would I end my days.
8455_210777_000023_000010 Mrs Neverbend should come with me, or stay, if it so pleased her, in Gladstonopolis.
8455_210777_000023_000011 Jack would become Eva's happy husband, and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world. Crasweller, the triumphant, would live, and at last die, amidst the flocks and herds of Little Christchurch.
8455_210777_000024_000002 It seemed to me as he entered the room and took the chair that was offered to him, that he was the greater man of the two on the occasion,--or perhaps I should say of the three. And yet he had not before come on shore to visit me, nor had he made one at our little dinner party.
8455_210777_000024_000005 But you must be aware that it has been our intention to interfere with that which you must regard as the performance of a duty."
8455_210777_000025_000000 "It is a duty," said i "But your power is so superior to any that I can advance, as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it.
8455_210777_000025_000001 Therefore we can be courteous while we submit.
8455_210777_000025_000003 But how can a little State, but a few years old, situated on a small island, far removed from all the centres of civilisation, contend on any point with the owner of the great two hundred fifty-ton swiveller gun?"
8455_210777_000026_000000 "That is all quite true, Mr Neverbend," said Sir Ferdinando Brown.
8455_210777_000029_000003 Therefore, I feel myself quite able, as President of this republic, to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally."
8455_210777_000030_000000 "Very well put," said Sir Ferdinando.
8455_210777_000030_000001 I simply bowed to him.
8455_210777_000030_000002 "And now," he continued, "will you answer me one question?"
8455_210777_000033_000000 I thought for a little what answer it would best become me to give to this question, but I paused only for a moment or two.
8455_210777_000034_000000 "And that in opposition to the wishes, as I understand, of a large proportion of your fellow citizens?"
8455_210777_000040_000000 "And you are, I am aware, sufficiently popular with the people here to enable you to do so?"
8455_210777_000041_000001 But I blushed for its untruth.
8455_210777_000043_000002 And I, looking at the matter from my own point of view, was a husband, the head of a family, a man largely concerned in business,--I was to be carried away in bondage-I, who had done no wrong, had disobeyed no law, who had indeed been conspicuous for my adherence to my duties!
8455_210777_000048_000000 "But what is the delicate mission?" I asked.
8455_210777_000049_000001 I was to be taken away and carried to England or elsewhere,--or drowned upon the voyage, it mattered not which.
8455_210777_000050_000001 Now, at the close of the twentieth century, could oppression be carried to such a height as this?
8455_210777_000050_000005 On myself, I need hardly say that it would be inoperative.
8455_210777_000050_000006 Though you should reduce me to atoms, from them would spring those opinions which would serve altogether to silence your artillery.
8455_210777_000051_000000 "You may be quite sure it's there," said Captain Battleax, "and that I can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board."
8455_210777_000052_000001 "What would become of your gun were I to kidnap you?"
8455_210777_000053_000000 "Lieutenant Crosstrees has sealed orders, and is practically acquainted with the mechanism of the gun.
8455_210777_000053_000001 Lieutenant Crosstrees is a very gallant officer.
8455_210777_000054_000001 "It is simply a contest between brute strength and mental energy."
8455_210777_000055_000000 "If you will look at the contests throughout the world," said Sir Ferdinando, "you will generally find that the highest respect is paid to the greatest battalions."
8455_210777_000056_000000 "What world-wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses!" said I, still turning myself to the captain; for though I would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible, my dislike centred itself on Sir Ferdinando.
8455_210777_000057_000001 In the meantime, my friend Captain Battleax has below a guard of fifty marines, who will pay you the respect of escorting you on board with two of the ship's cutters.
8455_210777_000059_000000 "That having all been pleasantly settled," said Sir Ferdinando, with a smile, "I will ask you to read the document by which this duty has been placed in my hands." He then took out of his pocket a letter addressed to him by the Duke of Hatfield, as Minister for the Crown Colonies, and gave it to me to read.
8455_210777_000061_000003 Minister of the day thought it expedient to grant their request.
8455_210777_000061_000004 The country has since undoubtedly prospered, and in a material point of view has given us no grounds for regret.
8455_210777_000061_000007 At the present moment a law has been passed which, if carried into action, would become abhorrent to mankind at large.
8455_210777_000062_000005 It is therefore desired that you should endeavour to obtain information as to his intentions; and that, if the Fixed Period be not abandoned altogether, with a clear conviction as to its cruelty on the part of the inhabitants generally, you should cause him to be carried away and brought to England.
8455_210777_000063_000000 To enable you to effect this, Captain Battleax, of h m gunboat the john Bright, has been instructed to carry you out.
8455_210777_000063_000001 The john Bright is armed with a weapon of great power, against which it is impossible that the people of Britannula should prevail.
8455_210777_000064_000000 In regard to Mr Neverbend himself, it is the especial wish of h m
8455_210777_000064_000001 Government that he shall be treated with all respect, and that those honours shall be paid to him which are due to the President of a friendly republic.
8455_210777_000065_000000 Captain Battleax, of the john Bright, will have received a letter to the same effect from the First Lord of the Admiralty, and you will find him ready to co-operate with your Excellency in every respect.--I have the honour to be, sir, your Excellency's most obedient servant,
8455_210777_000067_000000 This I read with great attention, while they sat silent.
8455_210777_000068_000000 "We have already lighted our fires, and our sailors are weighing the anchors.
8455_210777_000068_000001 Will twelve o'clock suit you?"
8455_210777_000069_000000 "To day!" I shouted.
8455_210777_000071_000000 "If so, you must be content to take my dead body.
8455_210777_000072_000000 "Half past ten," said the captain, looking at his watch.
8455_210777_000075_000000 "No doubt,--knowing nothing of the forms of our government, or-"
8455_210777_000076_000000 "They, of course, must all be altered."
8455_210777_000077_000001 It is quite impossible.
8455_210777_000079_000000 Alas!
8455_210777_000079_000002 All this I could hardly explain to him, as I should thus be giving to him the strongest evidence against my own philosophy.
8455_210777_000081_000001 "It is always well to be on the safe side."
8455_210777_000083_000001 This was the first complimentary speech which Sir Ferdinando had made, and I must confess that it was efficacious.
8455_210777_000084_000002 And this plan was adopted, too, in order to extract from me a promise that I would depart in peace. At any rate, I did make the promise, and gave these two gentlemen my word that I would be present there in my own room in the executive chambers at the same hour on the day but one following.
8455_210777_000087_000000 With this the two gentlemen left the room.
8461_258277_000000_000000 When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighteenth Night,
8461_258277_000001_000001 The knocker replied, "Kamar, daughter of Azariah the Jew; say me, is Ali of Cairo with you?" Replied the broker's daughter, "O thou daughter of a dog!
8461_258277_000001_000004 Now the cause of her slaying her sire was as follows.
8461_258277_000001_000005 On the night of his turning Ali into a dog, she saw, in a dream, a speaker who said to her, "Become a Moslemah." She did so; and as soon as she awoke next morning she expounded Al Islam to her father who refused to embrace the Faith; so she drugged him with Bhang and killed him.
8461_258277_000001_000007 On his way he met a sweetmeat seller, who was beating hand upon hand and saying, "There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!
8461_258277_000001_000011 Eat of it and make the like of it." So he ate and fell down senseless, for the sweetmeats were drugged with Bhang, whereupon the Kazi bundled him into the sack and made off with him, charger and chest and all, to the barrack of the Forty.
8461_258277_000001_000018 Knowest thou whither he went?" Answered Hasan, "I know where he is," and opening the door of the closet, showed him the sweetmeat seller within, drugged and senseless.
8461_258277_000002_000000 When it was the Seven Hundred and Nineteenth Night,
8461_258277_000003_000001 Then Ali rose; and, casting the Jew's head down before him, said, "May thine every enemy be like this one, O Prince of True Believers!" Quoth Al Rashid, "Whose head is this?"; and quoth Ali, "'tis the head of Azariah the Jew." "Who slew him?" asked the Caliph.
8461_258277_000003_000007 Then the tiring women displayed Zaynab before Ali in the dress of the Jew's daughter, and he went in unto her and found her a pearl unthridden and a filly by all save himself unridden.
8461_258277_000003_000008 Then he went in unto the three other maidens and found them accomplished in beauty and loveliness.
8461_258277_000006_000000 When it was the Seven Hundred and Twentieth Night,
8461_258277_000007_000004 Moreover, he took with him of his Mamelukes and negro slaves and cattle all that he needed for the road and clad himself and the Wazir and their company in traders' gear.
8461_258277_000009_000001 Presently, the Prince again became impatient of the length of the way and bethought him of his beloved and recited these couplets,
8461_258277_000011_000001 Then said the Minister to the Prince, "Rejoice, O King's son, in all good; for see, yonder is the White City, that which thou seekest." Whereat the Prince rejoiced with exceeding joy and recited these couplets,
8461_278226_000001_000000 A DISCOVERY AT THE LUXEMBOURG.
8461_278226_000003_000001 But it was not the less the most charming city in the universe; and Philip Jocelyn and his wife were as happy as two children in this paradise of brick and mortar.
8461_278226_000004_000000 They suited each other so well; they were never tired of each other's society, or at a stand still for want of something to say to each other. They were rather frivolous, perhaps; but a little frivolity may be pardoned in two people who were so very young and so entirely happy.
8461_278226_000004_000001 Sir Philip may have been a little too much devoted to horses and dogs, and Laura may have been a shade too enthusiastic upon the subject of new bonnets, and the jewellery in the Rue de la Paix.
8461_278226_000004_000004 And Laura had her own pet plans.
8461_278226_000007_000000 One morning Laura told her husband, with a gay laugh, that she was going to victimize him; but he was to promise to be patient and bear with her for once in a way.
8461_278226_000008_000000 "What is it you want me to do, my darling?"
8461_278226_000009_000000 "I want you to give me a long day in the Luxembourg.
8461_278226_000009_000001 I want to see all the pictures-the modern pictures especially.
8461_278226_000009_000002 I remember all the Rubenses at the Louvre, for I saw them three years ago, when I was staying in Paris with grandpapa.
8461_278226_000009_000003 I like the modern pictures best, Philip: and I want you to tell me all about the artists, and what I ought to admire, and all that sort of thing."
8461_278226_000010_000000 Sir Philip never refused his wife anything; so he said, yes: and Laura ran away to her dressing room like a school girl who has been pleading for a holiday and has won her cause.
8461_278226_000010_000001 She returned in a little more than ten minutes, in the freshest toilette, all pale shimmering blue, like the spring sky, with pearl grey gloves and boots and parasol, and a bonnet that seemed made of azure butterflies.
8461_278226_000013_000000 Philip Jocelyn was examining some pictures on the other side of the room when his wife made this discovery.
8461_278226_000013_000001 She hurried to him immediately, and led him off to look at the picture.
8461_278226_000013_000002 It was a peasant girl's head, very exquisitely painted by a modern artist, and the baronet approved his wife's taste.
8461_278226_000014_000000 "How I wish you could get me a copy of that picture, Philip," Laura said, entreatingly.
8461_278226_000014_000001 "I should so like one to hang in my morning room at Jocelyn's Rock.
8461_278226_000014_000002 I wonder who painted that lovely face?"
8461_278226_000017_000000 "And his name, monsieur?"
8461_278226_000018_000000 "He calls himself Kerstall-Frederick Kerstall; he is the son of an old monsieur, who calls himself also Kerstall, and who had much of celebrity in England it is many years."
8461_278226_000019_000000 "Kerstall!" exclaimed Laura, suddenly; "mr
8461_278226_000020_000000 She turned to the French artist presently, and asked him where the elder mr Kerstall lived, and if there was any possibility of seeing him.
8461_278226_000021_000000 The painter shrugged up his shoulders, and pursed up his mouth, thoughtfully.
8461_278226_000022_000000 "But, madame," he said, "this Monsieur Kerstall's father is very old, and he has ceased to paint it is a long time.
8461_278226_000022_000001 They have said that he is even a little imbecile, that he does not remember himself of the most common events of his life.
8461_278226_000022_000002 But there are some others who say that his memory has not altogether failed, and that he is still enough harshly critical towards the works of others."
8461_278226_000023_000000 The Frenchman might have run on much longer upon this subject, but Laura was too impatient to be polite.
8461_278226_000024_000000 The artist took out one of his own cards, and wrote the required address in pencil.
8461_278226_000025_000001 "I don't think you will have any difficulty in finding the house."
8461_278226_000026_000000 Laura thanked the French artist and then took her husband's arm and walked away with him.
8461_278226_000027_000001 You will be doing me such a favour, Philip, if you'll say yes."
8461_278226_000028_000000 "When did I ever say no to anything you asked me, Laura?
8461_278226_000028_000001 We'll go to mr Kerstall immediately, if you like.
8461_278226_000028_000002 But why are you so anxious to see this old portrait of your father, my dear?"
8461_278226_000029_000000 "Because I want to see what he was before he went to India.
8461_278226_000029_000001 I want to see what he was when he was bright and young before the world had hardened him.
8461_278226_000029_000002 Ah, Philip, since we have known and loved each other, it seems to me as if I had no thought or care for any one in all this wide world except yourself.
8461_278226_000029_000003 But before that time I was very unhappy about my father.
8461_278226_000029_000004 I had expected that he would be so fond of me.
8461_278226_000029_000006 I had thought all this, Philip; night after night I had dreamt the same dream,--the bright happy dream in which my father came home to me, the fond foolish dream in which I felt his strong arms folded round me, and his true heart beating against my own.
8461_278226_000030_000000 Laura said all this in a very low voice as she walked with her husband through the garden of the Luxembourg.
8461_281231_000001_000000 When at length the attack upon the castle was commenced all was at once bustle and clamour within its gloomy walls.
8461_281231_000001_000004 Showers of well directed arrows came pouring against each embrasure and opening in the parapets, as well as every window where a defender might be suspected to be stationed; and these were answered by a furious discharge of whizzing shafts and missiles from the walls.
8461_281231_000002_000000 And so for some time the fight went on; many combatants falling on either side.
8461_281231_000002_000001 But soon the conflict became even more desperate when the Black Knight, at the head of a body of his followers, led an attack upon the outer barrier of the barbican.
8461_281231_000005_000000 An interval of quiet now succeeded, the besiegers remaining in possession of the outer defences of the castle, and the besieged retiring for the time within the walls of the fortress.
8461_281231_000006_000000 During the confusion which reigned amongst the followers of Front de Boeuf when the attack had commenced, Rebecca had been allowed to take the place of the old crone, Ulrica, who was in close attendance on the wounded man who had been brought into the castle in company with Isaac of York and the other captives.
8461_281231_000006_000001 The sufferer was Ivanhoe himself, who had so mysteriously disappeared on the conclusion of the tournament, when his father, Cedric, had sent his servants to attend him to a place of safety.
8461_281231_000006_000002 The gallant young warrior, who, as he fell fainting to the ground, seemed to be abandoned by all the world, had been transported from the lists at the entreaty of Rebecca, to the house at Ashby then occupied by Isaac of York, where his wounds were dressed and tended by the Jewish maiden herself.
8461_281231_000006_000004 It was on their journey to that town that they were overtaken on the road by Cedric and his party, in whose company they were afterwards carried captive to the Castle of Torquilstone.
8461_281231_000007_000000 But to return to the assault.
8461_281231_000009_000000 "Who is there?
8461_281231_000009_000001 What art thou?" he exclaimed in terror.
8461_281231_000009_000002 "Depart, and haunt my couch no more; let me die in peace."
8461_281231_000010_000000 "In peace thou shalt NOT die," repeated the voice; "even in death shalt thou think on the groans which this castle has echoed, on the blood that is engrained in its floors."
8461_281231_000011_000000 "Go, leave me, fiend!" replied the wounded Norman.
8461_281231_000011_000001 "Leave me and seek the Saxon witch, Ulrica, who was my temptress; let her, as well as I, taste the tortures which anticipate hell."
8461_281231_000013_000000 "Detestable fury!" exclaimed the Norman.
8461_281231_000014_000000 "Call on them again, valiant baron," said the hag, with a smile of grisly mockery; "but know, mighty chief, thou shalt have neither answer nor aid.
8461_281231_000014_000002 And know, too, even now, the doom which all thy power and strength is unable to avoid, though it is prepared for thee by this feeble hand.
8461_281231_000014_000003 Markest thou the smouldering and suffocating vapour which already eddies in sable folds through the chamber? Rememberest thou the magazine of fuel that is stored beneath these apartments?"
8461_281231_000016_000000 "They are fast rising, at least," said Ulrica; "and a signal shall soon wave to warn the besiegers to press hard upon those who would extinguish them.
8461_281231_000018_000000 Meanwhile, the Black Knight had led his forces again to the attack; and so vigorous was their assault, that before long the gate of the castle alone separated them from those within.
8461_281231_000019_000004 At length De Bracy fell.
8461_281231_000020_000000 "Yield thee, De Bracy," said the Black Champion, stooping over him, and holding against the bars of his helmet the fatal poniard with which the knights despatched their enemies.
8461_281231_000020_000001 "Yield thee, rescue or no rescue, or thou art but a dead man."
8461_281231_000021_000000 "I will not yield," replied the Norman faintly, "to an unknown conqueror.
8461_281231_000021_000001 Tell me thy name, or work thy pleasure on me."
8461_281231_000023_000000 "I yield me to be true prisoner, rescue or no rescue," then answered De Bracy, in a tone of sullen submission.
8461_281231_000024_000000 "Go to the barbican," said the victor in a tone of authority, "and wait there my further orders."
8461_281231_000025_000000 "Yet first let me say," said De Bracy, "what it imports thee to know.
8461_281231_000025_000001 Wilfred of Ivanhoe is wounded and a prisoner, and will perish in the burning castle without present help."
8461_281231_000026_000000 "Wilfred of Ivanhoe!" exclaimed the Black Knight-"prisoner, and perish!
8461_281231_000026_000001 The life of every man in the castle shall answer it if a hair of his head be singed.
8461_281231_000026_000002 Show me his chamber!"
8461_281231_000027_000000 When the Black Knight reached the room, Ivanhoe was alone. Rebecca, who had remained with him until a few moments before, had just been carried off forcibly by Bois Guilbert.
8461_281231_000028_000000 One turret was now in bright flames, which flashed out furiously from window and shot hole.
8461_281231_000029_000000 As the fire commenced to spread rapidly through all parts of the castle, Ulrica appeared on one of the turrets.
8461_281231_000029_000001 Her long dishevelled gray hair flew back from her uncovered head, while the delight of gratified vengeance contended in her eyes with the fire of insanity.
8461_281231_000029_000002 Before long the towering flames had surmounted every obstruction, and rose to the evening skies one huge and burning beacon, seen far and wide through the adjacent country; tower after tower crashed down, with blazing roof and rafter.
8461_281231_000029_000003 The vanquished, of whom very few remained, scattered and escaped into the neighbouring wood.
8461_281231_000029_000004 The maniac figure of Ulrica was for a long time visible on the lofty stand she had chosen, tossing her arms abroad with wild exultation.
8461_281231_000034_000000 "He is already thine," said Locksley, "and well for him!"
8461_281231_000035_000000 "De Bracy," said the knight, "thou art free; depart.
8461_281231_000035_000002 Maurice de Bracy, I say, BEWARE!" De Bracy bowed low and in silence, threw himself upon a horse, and galloped off through the wood.
8461_281231_000036_000001 Here is a bugle, which an English yeoman has once worn; I pray you to keep it as a memorial of your gallant bearing.
8461_281231_000037_000000 "Gramercy for the gift, bold yeoman," said the knight; "and better help than thine and thy rangers would I never seek, were it at my utmost need."
8461_281231_000038_000000 So saying, he mounted his strong war horse, and rode off through the forest.
8461_281231_000039_000003 And with this epistle the unhappy old man set out to procure his daughter's liberation.
8461_281231_000042_000000 Prince john turned pale, tottered, and caught at the back of an oaken bench to support himself.
8461_281231_000043_000001 He appealed to De Bracy to assist him in this project, and became at once deeply suspicious of the knight's loyalty towards him when he declined to lift hand against the man who had spared his own life.
8461_281231_000045_000002 He had come, the Jew was informed, for the purpose of correcting and punishing many of the members of the body whose conduct had of late been open to severe censure; and he was recognised, besides, as the most tyrannical oppressor of the Jewish people.
8461_281231_000046_000002 Beaumanoir tore open the seal and perused the letter in haste, with an expression of surprise and horror.
8461_281231_000046_000004 He denounced Rebecca as a witch, by whose enchantment Bois Guilbert had been led to offend against the rules of the Holy Order, and in tones of passion and scorn he refused to listen to Isaac's protestations of her innocence.
8461_281231_000047_000000 "Spurn this Jew from the gate," he said to one of his attendants, "and shoot him dead if he oppose or turn again.
8461_281231_000047_000001 With his daughter we will deal as the Christian law and our own high office warrant."
8461_281231_000048_000001 He had hitherto feared for his daughter's honour; he was now to tremble for her life.
8461_281231_000050_000000 When the ponderous castle bell had tolled the point of noon, the Jewess was led from her secluded chamber into the great hall in which the Grand Master had for the time established his court of justice.
8461_281231_000052_000000 The whole assembly wore an aspect of the most profound gravity- the reflection, as it were, of the sombre countenance of the austere and relentless Grand Master.
8463_287645_000001_000000 JULIUS SMITH, WIFE MARY, AND BOY james, HENRY AND EDWARD SMITH, AND JACK CHRISTY.
8463_287645_000002_000000 While this party was very respectable in regard to numbers and enlisted much sympathy, still they had no wounds or bruises to exhibit, or very hard reports to make relative to their bondage.
8463_287645_000002_000001 The treatment that had been meted out to them was about as tolerant as Slavery could well afford; and the physical condition of the passengers bore evidence that they had been used to something better than herring and corn cake for a diet.
8463_287645_000003_000000 Julius, who was successful enough to bring his wife and boy with him, was a wonderful specimen of muscular proportions.
8463_287645_000003_000001 Although a young man, of but twenty five, he weighed two hundred and twenty five pounds; he was tall and well formed from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet.
8463_287645_000003_000002 Nor was he all muscle by a great deal; he was well balanced as to mother wit and shrewdness.
8463_287645_000005_000000 Julius had been kept in the dark in Maryland, but on free soil, the light rushed in upon his astonished vision to a degree almost bewildering.
8463_287645_000005_000001 That his master was a man of "means and pretty high standing"--Julius thought was not much to his credit since they were obtained from unpaid labor.
8463_287645_000005_000002 In his review allusion was made not only to his master, but also to his mistress, in which he said that she was "a quarrelsome and crabbed woman, middling stout." In order to show a reason why he left as he did, he stated that "there had been a fuss two or three times" previous to the escape, and it had been rumored "that somebody would have to be sold soon."
8463_287645_000005_000003 This was what did the mischief so far as the "running away" was concerned.
8463_287645_000005_000004 Julius' color was nearly jet black, and his speech was very good considering his lack of book learning; his bearing was entirely self possessed and commendable.
8463_287645_000006_000000 His wife and boy shared fully in his affections, and seemed well pleased to have their faces turned Canada ward.
8463_287645_000006_000001 It is hardly necessary to say more of them here.
8463_287645_000007_000000 Henry was about twenty three years of age, of an active turn, brown skin, and had given the question of freedom his most serious attention, as his actions proved.
8463_287645_000007_000002 From the manner in which he expressed himself, with regard to Robert Hollan, no man in the whole range of his recollections will be longer remembered than he; his enthralment while under Hollan will hardly ever be forgotten.
8463_287645_000008_000000 Of this party, Edward, a boy of seventeen, called forth much sympathy; he too was claimed by Hollan.
8463_287645_000009_000000 ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, eighteen fifty eight.
8463_287645_000011_000000 The revelations made by these passengers were painful to listen to, and would not have been credited if any room had existed for doubt.
8463_287645_000012_000000 john Wesley was thirty two years of age, of a lively turn, pleasant countenance, dark color, and ordinary size.
8463_287645_000012_000003 A few years back one of their slaves, a coachman, was kept on the coach box one cold night when they were out at a ball until he became almost frozen to death, in fact he did die in the infirmary from the effects of the frost about one week afterwards."
8463_287645_000013_000000 "Another case was that of a slave woman in a very delicate state, who was one day knocked down stairs by mrs Johnson herself, and in a few weeks after, the poor woman died from the effects of the injury thus received.
8463_287645_000013_000003 The mistress professed to know nothing about it, simply said, 'she went to sleep and fell out herself.' As usual nothing was done in the way of punishment."
8463_287645_000014_000000 These were specimens of the inner workings of the peculiar institution. john, however, had not only observed Slavery from a domestic stand point, he had also watched master and mistress abroad as visitors and guests in other people's houses, noticed not only how they treated white people, but also how they treated black people.
8463_287645_000014_000001 "These Johnsons thought that they were first rate to their servants.
8463_287645_000015_000000 As to advertising him, john gave it as his opinion that they would be ashamed to do it from the fact that they had already rendered themselves more notorious than they had bargained for, on account of their cruelty towards their slaves; they were wealthy, and courted the good opinion of society.
8463_287645_000015_000001 Besides they were members of the Presbyterian Church, and john thought that they were very willing that people should believe that they were great saints.
8463_287645_000016_000000 With John's intelligence, large observation, good memory, and excellent natural abilities, with the amount of detail that he possessed, nothing more would have been needed for a thrilling book than the facts and incidents of slave life, as he had been conversant with it under the Johnsons in Maryland.
8463_287645_000018_000000 two thousand dollars REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, living on the York Turnpike, eight miles from Baltimore city, on sunday april eleventh, my negro man, JACOB, aged twenty years: five feet ten inches high; chestnut color; spare made; good features.
8463_287645_000018_000001 I will give fifty dollars reward if taken in Baltimore city or county, and two hundred dollars if taken out of the State and secured in jail so that I get him again.
8463_287645_000020_000001 j b PARLETT.
8463_287645_000022_000001 j b Parlett's advertisement, gave his views of the man who had enslaved him.
8463_287645_000022_000003 I never knew of but one man who could ever please him.
8463_287645_000022_000004 He worked me very hard; he wanted to be beating me all the time."
8463_287645_000023_000001 For instance, Jacob Taylor was noticed on the record book as being twenty three years of age, and the name of his master was entered as "William Pollit;" but as Jacob had never been allowed to learn to read, he might have failed in giving a correct pronunciation of the name.
8463_287645_000024_000000 When asked what first prompted him to seek his freedom, he replied, "Oh my senses!
8463_287645_000024_000001 I always had it in my mind to leave, but I was 'jubus', (dubious?) of starting.
8463_287645_000024_000002 I didn't know the way to come.
8463_287645_000024_000003 I was afraid of being overtaken on the way." He fled from near Baltimore, where he left brothers and other relatives in chains.
8463_287645_000030_000001 He hated everything like Slavery, and as young as he was, he had already made five attempts to escape.
8463_287645_000030_000002 On this occasion, with older and wiser heads, he succeeded.
8463_294825_000015_000000 "The deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us," admits Professor Aronnax early in this novel.
8463_294825_000015_000001 "What goes on in those distant depths?
8463_294825_000015_000002 What creatures inhabit, or could inhabit, those regions twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water? It's almost beyond conjecture."
8463_294825_000016_000001 one hundred twenty six years later, a Time cover story on deep-sea exploration made much the same admission: "We know more about Mars than we know about the oceans." This reality begins to explain the dark power and otherworldly fascination of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas.
8463_294825_000017_000001 First as a Paris stockbroker, later as a celebrated author and yachtsman, he went on frequent voyages- to Britain, America, the Mediterranean.
8463_294825_000018_000000 Initially, Verne's narrative was influenced by the eighteen sixty three uprising of Poland against Tsarist Russia.
8463_294825_000018_000001 The Poles were quashed with a violence that appalled not only Verne but all Europe.
8463_294825_000019_000000 But in the eighteen sixties France had to treat the Tsar as an ally, and Verne's publisher Pierre Hetzel pronounced the book unprintable. Verne reworked its political content, devising new nationalities for Nemo and his great enemy-information revealed only in a later novel, The Mysterious Island (eighteen seventy five); in the present work Nemo's background remains a dark secret.
8463_294825_000020_000000 Verne is often dubbed, in Isaac Asimov's phrase, "the world's first science fiction writer." And it's true, many of his sixty odd books do anticipate future events and technologies: From the Earth to the Moon (eighteen sixty five) and Hector Servadac (eighteen seventy seven) deal in space travel, while Journey to the Center
8463_294825_000021_000000 of the Earth features travel to the earth's core.
8463_294825_000021_000001 But with Verne the operative word is "travel," and some of his best known titles don't really qualify as scifi: Around the World in Eighty Days (eighteen seventy two) and Michael Strogoff (eighteen seventy six) are closer to "travelogs"-- adventure yarns in far away places.
8463_294825_000022_000000 These observations partly apply here.
8463_294825_000022_000001 The subtitle of the present book is An Underwater Tour of the World, so in good travelog style, the Nautilus's exploits supply an episodic story line. Shark attacks, giant squid, cannibals, hurricanes, whale hunts, and other rip roaring adventures erupt almost at random.
8463_294825_000022_000002 Yet this loose structure gives the novel an air of documentary realism.
8463_294825_000022_000004 These unifying threads tighten the narrative and accelerate its momentum.
8463_294825_000023_000000 Other subtleties occur inside each episode, the textures sparkling with wit, information, and insight.
8463_294825_000023_000002 And Verne's marine engineering proves especially authoritative.
8463_294825_000023_000003 His specifications for an open sea submarine and a self-contained diving suit were decades before their time, yet modern technology bears them out triumphantly.
8463_294825_000024_000000 True, today's scientists know a few things he didn't: the South Pole isn't at the water's edge but far inland; sharks don't flip over before attacking; giant squid sport ten tentacles not eight; sperm whales don't prey on their whalebone cousins.
8463_294825_000024_000001 This notwithstanding, Verne furnishes the most evocative portrayal of the ocean depths before the arrival of Jacques Cousteau and technicolor film.
8463_294825_000025_000000 Lastly the book has stature as a novel of character.
8463_294825_000025_000001 Even the supporting cast is shrewdly drawn: Professor Aronnax, the career scientist caught in an ethical conflict; Conseil, the compulsive classifier who supplies humorous tag lines for Verne's fast facts; the harpooner Ned Land, a creature of constant appetites, man as heroic animal.
8463_294825_000026_000000 But much of the novel's brooding power comes from Captain Nemo. Inventor, musician, Renaissance genius, he's a trail blazing creation, the prototype not only for countless renegade scientists in popular fiction, but even for such varied figures as Sherlock Holmes or Wolf Larsen.
8463_294825_000026_000001 However, Verne gives his hero's brilliance and benevolence a dark underside-the man's obsessive hate for his old enemy.
8463_294825_000026_000002 This compulsion leads Nemo into ugly contradictions: he's a fighter for freedom, yet all who board his ship are imprisoned there for good; he works to save lives, both human and animal, yet he himself creates a holocaust; he detests imperialism, yet he lays personal claim to the South Pole.
8463_294825_000026_000003 And in this last action he falls into the classic sin of Pride.
8463_294825_000027_000000 Like Shakespeare's King Lear he courts death and madness in a great storm, then commits mass murder, collapses in catatonic paralysis, and suicidally runs his ship into the ocean's most dangerous whirlpool. Hate swallows him whole.
8463_294825_000030_000000 Because, as that Time cover story suggests, we still haven't caught up with Verne.
8463_294825_000030_000001 Even in our era of satellite dishes and video games, the seas keep their secrets.
8463_294825_000030_000002 We've seen progress in sonar, torpedoes, and other belligerent machinery, but sailors and scientists- to say nothing of tourists-have yet to voyage in a submarine with the luxury and efficiency of the Nautilus.

8463_294828_000011_000000 CHAPTER three
8463_294828_000012_000000 As Master Wishes
8463_294828_000013_000000 THREE SECONDS before the arrival of j b Hobson's letter, I no more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the Northwest Passage.
8463_294828_000013_000001 Three seconds after reading this letter from the honorable Secretary of the Navy, I understood at last that my true vocation, my sole purpose in life, was to hunt down this disturbing monster and rid the world of it.
8463_294828_000014_000000 Even so, I had just returned from an arduous journey, exhausted and badly needing a rest.
8463_294828_000014_000001 I wanted nothing more than to see my country again, my friends, my modest quarters by the Botanical Gardens, my dearly beloved collections!
8463_294828_000014_000002 But now nothing could hold me back. I forgot everything else, and without another thought of exhaustion, friends, or collections, I accepted the American government's offer.
8463_294828_000015_000000 "Besides," I mused, "all roads lead home to Europe, and our unicorn may be gracious enough to take me toward the coast of France!
8463_294828_000017_000000 "Conseil!" I called in an impatient voice.
8463_294828_000018_000000 Conseil was my manservant.
8463_294828_000018_000001 A devoted lad who went with me on all my journeys; a gallant Flemish boy whom I genuinely liked and who returned the compliment; a born stoic, punctilious on principle, habitually hardworking, rarely startled by life's surprises, very skillful with his hands, efficient in his every duty, and despite his having a name that means "counsel," never giving advice- not even the unsolicited kind!
8463_294828_000019_000000 From rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the Botanical Gardens, the boy had come to know a thing or two. In Conseil I had a seasoned specialist in biological classification, an enthusiast who could run with acrobatic agility up and down the whole ladder of branches, groups, classes, subclasses, orders, families, genera, subgenera, species, and varieties. But there his science came to a halt.
8463_294828_000020_000000 For the past ten years, Conseil had gone with me wherever science beckoned.
8463_294828_000020_000002 Never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any country whatever, China or the Congo, no matter how far off it was. He went here, there, and everywhere in perfect contentment. Moreover, he enjoyed excellent health that defied all ailments, owned solid muscles, but hadn't a nerve in him, not a sign of nerves- the mental type, I mean.
8463_294828_000021_000000 The lad was thirty years old, and his age to that of his employer was as fifteen is to twenty.
8463_294828_000022_000000 But Conseil had one flaw.
8463_294828_000022_000001 He was a fanatic on formality, and he only addressed me in the third person-to the point where it got tiresome.
8463_294828_000023_000000 "Conseil!" I repeated, while feverishly beginning my preparations for departure.
8463_294828_000024_000000 To be sure, I had confidence in this devoted lad.
8463_294828_000024_000002 There was good reason to stop and think, even for the world's most emotionless man. What would Conseil say?
8463_294828_000025_000000 "Conseil!" I called a third time.
8463_294828_000026_000000 Conseil appeared.
8463_294828_000027_000000 "Did master summon me?" he said, entering.
8463_294828_000028_000000 "Yes, my boy.
8463_294828_000028_000001 Get my things ready, get yours ready. We're departing in two hours."
8463_294828_000030_000000 "We haven't a moment to lose.
8463_294828_000030_000001 Pack as much into my trunk as you can, my traveling kit, my suits, shirts, and socks, don't bother counting, just squeeze it all in-and hurry!"
8463_294828_000031_000000 "What about master's collections?" Conseil ventured to observe.
8463_294828_000032_000000 "We'll deal with them later."
8463_294828_000033_000000 "What!
8463_294828_000033_000001 The archaeotherium, hyracotherium, oreodonts, cheiropotamus, and master's other fossil skeletons?"
8463_294828_000034_000000 "The hotel will keep them for us."
8463_294828_000035_000000 "What about master's live babirusa?"
8463_294828_000036_000000 "They'll feed it during our absence.
8463_294828_000036_000001 Anyhow, we'll leave instructions to ship the whole menagerie to France."
8463_294828_000037_000000 "Then we aren't returning to Paris?" Conseil asked.
8463_294828_000038_000000 "Yes, we are . . . certainly . . . ," I replied evasively, "but after we make a detour."
8463_294828_000039_000000 "Whatever detour master wishes."
8463_294828_000040_000000 "Oh, it's nothing really!
8463_294828_000040_000001 A route slightly less direct, that's all. We're leaving on the Abraham Lincoln."
8463_294828_000041_000000 "As master thinks best," Conseil replied placidly.
8463_294828_000042_000001 We're going to rid the seas of it! The author of a two volume work, in quarto, on The Mysteries of the Great Ocean Depths has no excuse for not setting sail with Commander Farragut.
8463_294828_000042_000002 It's a glorious mission but also a dangerous one!
8463_294828_000042_000003 We don't know where it will take us!
8463_294828_000042_000004 These beasts can be quite unpredictable!
8463_294828_000043_000000 "What master does, I'll do," Conseil replied.
8463_294828_000045_000000 "As master wishes."
8463_294828_000046_000000 A quarter of an hour later, our trunks were ready.
8463_294828_000046_000001 Conseil did them in a flash, and I was sure the lad hadn't missed a thing, because he classified shirts and suits as expertly as birds and mammals.
8463_294828_000047_000000 The hotel elevator dropped us off in the main vestibule on the mezzanine. I went down a short stair leading to the ground floor. I settled my bill at that huge counter that was always under siege by a considerable crowd.
8463_294828_000047_000001 I left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to Paris, France.
8463_294828_000047_000002 I opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the babirusa and, Conseil at my heels, I jumped into a carriage.
8463_294828_000048_000001 There the Katrin ferry transferred men, horses, and carriage to Brooklyn, that great New York annex located on the left bank of the East River, and in a few minutes we arrived at the wharf next to which the Abraham Lincoln was vomiting torrents of black smoke from its two funnels.
8463_294828_000049_000000 Our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate. I rushed aboard.
8463_294828_000049_000001 I asked for Commander Farragut.
8463_294828_000050_000000 "Professor Pierre Aronnax?" he said to me.
8463_294828_000051_000000 "The same," I replied.
8463_294828_000051_000001 "Commander Farragut?"
8463_294828_000052_000000 "In person.
8463_294828_000052_000001 Welcome aboard, professor.
8463_294828_000052_000002 Your cabin is waiting for you."
8463_294828_000053_000000 I bowed, and letting the commander attend to getting under way, I was taken to the cabin that had been set aside for me.
8463_294828_000054_000000 The Abraham Lincoln had been perfectly chosen and fitted out for its new assignment.
8463_294828_000054_000001 It was a high-speed frigate furnished with superheating equipment that allowed the tension of its steam to build to seven atmospheres.
8463_294828_000054_000002 Under this pressure the Abraham Lincoln reached an average speed of eighteen point three miles per hour, a considerable speed but still not enough to cope with our gigantic cetacean.
8463_294828_000057_000000 "With all due respect to master," Conseil replied, "as comfortable as a hermit crab inside the shell of a whelk."
8463_294828_000058_000000 I left Conseil to the proper stowing of our luggage and climbed on deck to watch the preparations for getting under way.
8463_294828_000060_000001 He summoned his engineer.
8463_294828_000061_000000 "Are we up to pressure?" he asked the man.
8463_294828_000062_000000 "Aye, sir," the engineer replied.
8463_294828_000063_000000 "Go ahead, then!" Commander Farragut called.
8463_294828_000064_000000 At this order, which was relayed to the engine by means of a compressed air device, the mechanics activated the start-up wheel. Steam rushed whistling into the gaping valves.
8463_294828_000066_000000 The wharves of Brooklyn, and every part of New York bordering the East River, were crowded with curiosity seekers. Departing from five hundred thousand throats, three cheers burst forth in succession. Thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses, hailing the Abraham
8463_294828_000067_000000 Lincoln until it reached the waters of the Hudson River, at the tip of the long peninsula that forms New York City.
8463_294828_000069_000000 The escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate and only left us when we came abreast of the lightship, whose two signal lights mark the entrance of the narrows to Upper New York Bay.
8463_294828_000070_000000 Three o'clock then sounded.
8555_284447_000003_000000 THE AMAZING CONQUEST OF THE BLUES
8555_284447_000005_000002 While he put on his clothes the king occasionally gave the cord a sudden pull, hoping to hurt Cap'n Bill's big toe and make him yell; but as no response came to this mean action the Boolooroo finally looked into the room, only to find he had been pulling on a leg of the couch and that his prisoner had escaped.
8555_284447_000008_000000 "So ho!" roared the monarch, "you thought you could defy me, Earth Clod, did you?
8555_284447_000008_000001 But you were mistaken.
8555_284447_000008_000002 No one can resist the Mighty Boolooroo of the Blues, so it is folly for you to rebel against my commands.
8555_284447_000008_000003 Hold him fast, my men, and as soon as I've had my coffee and oatmeal I'll take him to the Room of the Great Knife and patch him."
8555_284447_000009_000000 "I wouldn't mind a cup o' coffee myself," said Cap'n Bill.
8555_284447_000010_000000 "Very well," replied the Boolooroo, "you shall eat with me, for then I can keep an eye on you.
8555_284447_000010_000001 My guards are not to be trusted, and I don't mean to let you out of my sight again until you are patched."
8555_284447_000011_000001 But Cap'n Bill made no such attempt, knowing it would be useless.
8555_284447_000012_000000 Trot was in the room, too, standing in a corner and listening to all that was said while she racked her little brain for an idea that would enable her to save Cap'n Bill from being patched.
8555_284447_000012_000001 No one could see her, so no one-not even Cap'n Bill-knew she was there.
8555_284447_000013_000000 After breakfast was over a procession was formed, headed by the Boolooroo, and they marched the prisoner through the palace until they came to the Room of the Great Knife.
8555_284447_000013_000001 Invisible Trot followed soberly after them, still wondering what she could do to save her friend.
8555_284447_000014_000000 As soon as they entered the Room of the Great Knife the Boolooroo gave a yell of disappointment.
8555_284447_000015_000000 "What's become of Tiggle?" he shouted.
8555_284447_000015_000001 "Where's Tiggle?
8555_284447_000015_000003 Go at once, you dummies, and find him-or it will go hard with you!"
8555_284447_000016_000000 The frightened soldiers hurried away to find Tiggle, and Trot was well pleased because she knew Tiggle was by this time safely hidden.
8555_284447_000017_000000 The Boolooroo stamped up and down the room, muttering threats and declaring Cap'n Bill should be patched whether Tiggle was found or not, and while they waited Trot took time to make an inspection of the place, which she now saw for the first time in broad daylight.
8555_284447_000018_000000 The Room of the Great Knife was high and big, and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon.
8555_284447_000018_000001 In one place-at the head of the room-was a raised platform for the royal family, with elegant throne chairs for the King and Queen and six smaller but richly upholstered chairs for the Snubnosed Princesses.
8555_284447_000018_000002 The poor Queen, by the way, was seldom seen, as she passed all her time playing solitaire with a deck that was one card short, hoping that before she had lived her entire six hundred years she would win the game.
8555_284447_000018_000003 Therefore her Majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her.
8555_284447_000019_000001 The knife was built into a huge framework, like a derrick, that reached to the ceiling, and it was so arranged that when the Boolooroo pulled a cord the great blade would drop down in its frame and neatly cut in two the person who stood under it.
8555_284447_000019_000002 And, in order that the slicing would be accurate, there was another frame, to which the prisoner was tied so that he couldn't wiggle either way.
8555_284447_000019_000003 This frame was on rollers, so that it could be placed directly underneath the knife.
8555_284447_000020_000000 While Trot was observing this dreadful machine the door opened and in walked the Six Snubnosed Princesses, all in a row and with their chins up, as if they disdained everyone but themselves.
8555_284447_000020_000002 These plumes waved gracefully in the air with every mincing step the Princesses took.
8555_284447_000020_000003 Rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as they were haughty and overbearing.
8555_284447_000020_000004 They marched to their chairs and seated themselves to enjoy the cruel scene their father was about to enact, and Cap'n Bill bowed to them politely and said:
8555_284447_000022_000000 "Papa," exclaimed Turquoise, angrily, "can you not prevent this vile Earth Being from addressing us?
8555_284447_000022_000001 It is an insult to be spoken to by one about to be patched."
8555_284447_000023_000000 "Control yourselves, my dears," replied the Boolooroo; "the worst punishment I know how to inflict on anyone, this prisoner is about to suffer.
8555_284447_000025_000000 "When?
8555_284447_000025_000001 As soon as the soldiers return with Tiggle," said he.
8555_284447_000026_000001 Immediately the Boolooroo flew into another towering rage.
8555_284447_000027_000000 "Villains!" he shouted, "go out and arrest the first living thing you meet, and whoever it proves to be will be instantly patched to Cap'n Bill."
8555_284447_000028_000000 The Captain of the Guards hesitated to obey this order.
8555_284447_000029_000000 "Suppose it's a friend?" he suggested.
8555_284447_000031_000000 The Captain shook his head.
8555_284447_000032_000000 "I can't think of anyone just now, your Spry and Flighty High and Mighty Majesty," he answered.
8555_284447_000033_000000 "Of course not," said the Boolooroo.
8555_284447_000033_000001 "Everyone hates me, and I don't object to that because I hate everybody.
8555_284447_000033_000002 But I'm the Ruler here, and I'll do as I please.
8555_284447_000033_000003 Go and capture the first living creature you see, and bring him here to be patched to Cap'n Bill."
8555_284447_000034_000000 So the Captain took a file of soldiers and went away very sorrowful, for he did not know who would be the victim, and if the Boolooroo had no friends, the Captain had plenty, and did not wish to see them patched.
8555_284447_000035_000000 Meantime Trot, being invisible to all, was roaming around the room and behind a bench she found a small coil of rope, which she picked up.
8555_284447_000035_000001 Then she seated herself in an out of the way place and quietly waited.
8555_284447_000036_000000 Suddenly there was a noise in the corridor and evidence of scuffling and struggling.
8555_284447_000036_000001 Then the door flew open and in came the soldiers dragging a great blue billygoat, which was desperately striving to get free.
8555_284447_000038_000000 "Why, you said to fetch the first living creature we met, and that was this billygoat," replied the Captain, panting hard as he held fast to one of the goat's horns.
8555_284447_000039_000000 The Boolooroo stared a moment and then he fell back in his throne, laughing boisterously.
8555_284447_000039_000001 The idea of patching Cap'n Bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him, and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter.
8555_284447_000039_000002 Some of the soldiers laughed, too, being tickled with the absurd notion, and the Six Snubnosed Princesses all sat up straight and permitted themselves to smile contemptuously.
8555_284447_000039_000003 This would indeed be a severe punishment; therefore the Princesses were pleased at the thought of Cap'n Bill's becoming half a billygoat, and the billygoat's being half Cap'n Bill.
8555_284447_000041_000000 "Splendid!
8555_284447_000041_000001 Fine!
8555_284447_000041_000002 Glorious!" cried the Boolooroo, wiping the tears of merriment from his eyes.
8555_284447_000041_000003 "We will proceed with the Ceremony of Patching at once."
8555_284447_000042_000001 Trot was horrified, and wrung her little hands in sore perplexity, for this was a most horrible fate that awaited her dear old friend.
8555_284447_000043_000000 "First, bind the Earth Man in the frame," commanded the Boolooroo. "We'll slice him in two before we do the same to the billygoat."
8555_284447_000044_000001 Then they rolled the frame underneath the Great Knife and handed the Boolooroo the cord that released the blade.
8555_284447_000045_000000 But while this was going on Trot had crept up and fastened one end of her rope to the frame in which Cap'n Bill was confined.
8555_284447_000045_000001 Then she stood back and watched the Boolooroo, and just as he pulled the cord she pulled on her rope and dragged the frame on its rollers away, so that the Great Knife fell with a crash and sliced nothing but the air.
8555_284447_000046_000000 "Huh!" exclaimed the Boolooroo; "that's queer.
8555_284447_000046_000001 Roll him up again, soldiers."
8555_284447_000047_000000 The soldiers again rolled the frame in position, having first pulled the Great Knife once more to the top of the derrick.
8555_284447_000047_000001 The immense blade was so heavy that it took the strength of seven Blueskins to raise it.
8555_284447_000048_000000 When all was in readiness the King pulled the cord a second time and Trot at the same instant pulled upon her rope.
8555_284447_000048_000001 The same thing happened as before.
8555_284447_000048_000002 Cap'n Bill rolled away in his frame and the knife fell harmlessly.
8555_284447_000049_000000 Now, indeed, the Boolooroo was as angry as he was amazed.
8555_284447_000049_000001 He jumped down from the platform and commanded the soldiers to raise the Great Knife into position.
8555_284447_000049_000002 When this had been accomplished the Boolooroo leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled away-seemingly of its own accord-and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before.
8555_284447_000050_000000 As he stood, bent nearly double, his back was toward the billygoat, which, in their interest and excitement, the soldiers were holding in a careless manner.
8555_284447_000050_000001 At once the goat gave a leap, escaped from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the Boolooroo.
8555_284447_000050_000002 Before any could stop him he butted his Majesty so furiously that the King soared far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches, where he lay moaning and groaning.
8555_284447_000051_000001 Finding himself free, he turned and assaulted the soldiers, butting them so fiercely that they tumbled down in bunches and as soon as they could rise again ran frantically from the room and along the corridors as if a fiend was after them.
8555_284447_000053_000003 He nodded cheerfully, then, and said:
8555_284447_000054_000001 But it were a pretty close call an' I hope it won't happen again.
8555_284447_000056_000000 "As how?" he asked, stepping from the frame.
8555_284447_000058_000000 The sailor followed and pulled out the Boolooroo, who, when he saw the terrible goat was captured and tied fast, quickly recovered his courage.
8555_284447_000059_000000 "Hi, there!" he cried; "where are my soldiers?
8555_284447_000059_000001 What do you mean, prisoner, by daring to lay hands upon me?
8555_284447_000060_000000 "Don't mind him, Cap'n," said Trot, "but fetch him along to the frame."
8555_284447_000063_000000 "Stop it!
8555_284447_000063_000002 "I'll have revenge!--I'll-I'll-"
8555_284447_000064_000000 "You'll take it easy, 'cause you can't help yourself," said Cap'n Bill. "What next, Queen Trot?"
8555_284447_000065_000000 "Hold him steady in the frame and I'll tie him up," she replied.
8555_284447_000065_000001 So Cap'n Bill held the Boolooroo, and the girl tied him fast in position, as Cap'n Bill had been tied, so that his Majesty couldn't wiggle at all.
8555_284447_000066_000000 Then they rolled the frame in position underneath the Great Knife and Trot held in her hand the cord which would release it.
8555_284447_000067_000000 "All right, Cap'n," she said in a satisfied tone, "I guess we can run this Blue Country ourselves, after this."
8555_284449_000006_000000 The soldiers wore their best blue uniforms and were formed before the palace in marching order, so Trot and Cap'n Bill headed the procession, and then came the soldiers-all keeping step-and then the bands, playing very loud noises on their instruments, and finally the crowd of Blue citizens waving flags and banners and shouting joyfully.
8555_284449_000007_000000 In this order they proceeded to the main gate, which Trot ordered the guards to throw wide open.
8555_284449_000007_000001 Then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the Army of Pinkies had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them.
8555_284449_000009_000000 However, as the two forces came nearer together, Button Bright spied Trot and Cap'n Bill standing before the enemy, and the sight astonished him considerably.
8555_284449_000011_000000 "Hooray!" yelled the parrot,
8555_284449_000013_000000 and then he flapped his wings and barked like a dog with pure delight, and added as fast as his bird's tongue could speak:
8555_284449_000015_000000 "Stop it!" said Button Bright; "I can't hear myself think."
8555_284449_000017_000000 "Pinkies," said she, "your Queen has conquered the Boolooroo and is now the Queen of the Blues.
8555_284449_000017_000001 All of Sky Island, except the Fog Bank, is now my kingdom, so I welcome my faithful Pinkies to my Blue City, where you are to be royally entertained and have a good time.
8555_284449_000020_000002 He was looking downcast and sad, and it was easy to see he was disappointed because he had not conquered the Boolooroo himself.
8555_284449_000020_000003 But the people called upon him for a speech, so he faced the Blueskins and said:
8555_284449_000021_000000 "I escaped from the City because the Boolooroo tried to patch me, as you all know, and the Six Snubnosed Princesses tried to marry me, which would have been a far greater misfortune.
8555_284449_000023_000000 "Here's a pretty howdy do- You haven't any Boolooroo!"
8555_284449_000024_000000 Trot had listened carefully to the Majordomo's speech.
8555_284449_000024_000001 When he finished she said cheerfully:
8555_284449_000025_000000 "Don't worry, Sizzle dear; it'll all come right pretty soon.
8555_284449_000025_000002 I'm nearly starved, myself, for this conquerin' kingdoms is hard work."
8555_284449_000028_000000 After they had eaten all they could, and the servants had been sent away, Trot related her adventures, telling how, with the assistance of the billygoat, she had turned the tables on the wicked Boolooroo.
8555_284449_000028_000001 Then she gave Rosalie back her magic ring, thanking the kind Witch for all she had done for them.
8555_284449_000029_000001 I'll always be Queen of Sky Island, but the Pink and Blue Countries must each have a Ruler.
8555_284449_000031_000001 But before I do that I want the privilege of patching the Snubnosed Princesses to each other-mixing the six as much as possible-and then I want to patch the former Boolooroo to the billygoat, which is the same punishment he was going to inflict upon Cap'n Bill."
8555_284449_000032_000000 "No," said Trot, positively, "there's been enough patching in this country and I won't have any more of it.
8555_284449_000033_000000 "You are, mate," replied the sailor.
8555_284449_000034_000001 It will be such a satisfaction."
8555_284449_000035_000000 "I have said no, an' I mean it," answered the girl.
8555_284449_000035_000001 "You let the poor old Boolooroo alone.
8555_284449_000037_000001 "Guess I'd better send for him an' tell him what's happened."
8555_284449_000038_000000 So the Captain of the Guards was given the key and told to fetch the Boolooroo from the Room of the Great Knife.
8555_284449_000038_000001 The guards had a terrible struggle with the goat, which was loose in the room and still wanted to fight, but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the Boolooroo out of the frame he was tied in and brought both him and the goat before Queen Trot, who awaited them in the throne room of the palace.
8555_284449_000039_000000 When the courtiers and the people assembled saw the goat they gave a great cheer, for the beast had helped to dethrone their wicked Ruler.
8555_284449_000040_000001 "It's my idee as he's braver than the whole Blue Army put together."
8555_284449_000041_000000 "You're right, Cap'n," she returned.
8555_284449_000041_000001 "I'll have 'Sizzle make a fine yard for the goat, where he'll have plenty of blue grass to eat.
8555_284449_000042_000000 "I'll gladly do that," promised the new Boolooroo; "and I'll feed the honorable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat, besides the grass.
8555_284449_000043_000000 As they led the now famous animal from the room the Boolooroo shuddered and said:
8555_284449_000044_000000 "How dare you people give orders in my palace?
8555_284449_000044_000001 I'm the Boolooroo!"
8555_284449_000045_000000 "'Scuse me," said Trot; "I neglected to tell you that you're not the Boolooroo any more.
8555_284449_000045_000003 He'll look after this end of the Island hereafter, an' unless I'm much mistaken he'll do it a heap better than you did."
8555_284449_000046_000000 The former Boolooroo groaned.
8555_284449_000047_000001 "Am I to be patched, or what?"
8555_284449_000048_000000 "You won't be hurt," answered the girl, "but you'll have to find some other place to stay besides this palace, an' perhaps you'll enjoy workin' for a livin, by way of variety."
8555_284449_000049_000000 "Can't I take any of the treasure with me?" he pleaded.
8555_284449_000050_000000 "Not even a bird cage," said she.
8555_284449_000051_000001 "Won't you please get rid of them, too, your Majesty?
8555_284449_000051_000002 Can't they be discharged?"
8555_284449_000053_000001 It isn't a very pretty cabin and the furniture is cheap and common, but I'm sure it is good enough for this wicked man and his family."
8555_284449_000055_000001 When first they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever, but the Blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and jeered them, for there was not a single person in all the Blue Country who loved the Princesses the least little bit.
8555_284449_000057_000000 This was done, the once royal family departing from the palace with shamed and downcast looks.
8555_284449_000058_000000 Then the Room of the Great Knife was cleared of its awful furniture.
8555_284449_000058_000002 All the rubbish was piled in the square before the palace and a bonfire made of it, while the Blue people clustered around and danced and sang with joy as the blue flames devoured the dreadful instrument that had once caused them so much unhappiness.
8555_284449_000059_000001 The combined bands of both the countries played the music and a fine supper was served.
8555_284449_000061_000000 "I think it will be best for us to go back to our own country as soon as possible," suggested Rosalie the Witch; "for, if we stay here very long, the Blueskins may rise against us and cause the Pinkies much trouble."
8555_292519_000003_000000 You are the star that made the skies all bright, Yet tore itself away in flaming flight; You are the tree that suddenly awoke; You are the rose that came to life and spoke....
8555_292519_000004_000000 Guided by you, how we might stroll towards death, Our only music one another's breath, Through gardens intimate with hollyhocks, Where silent poppies burn between the rocks, By pools where birches bend to confidants Above green waters scummed with lily plants.
8555_292519_000005_000000 There we might wander, you and I alone, Through gardens filled with marble seats moss grown, And fountains-water threads that winds disperse- While in the spray the birds sit and converse.
8555_292519_000006_000000 And when the fireflies mix their circling glow Through the dark plants, then gently might I know Your lips, light as the wings of the dragon flies....
8555_292519_000008_000000 [YOU THOUGHT I HAD FORGOTTEN]
8555_292519_000009_000000 You thought I had forgotten.
8555_292519_000009_000001 Well, I had! (Although I never guessed I could forget Those few great moments when we both went mad.)
8555_292519_000010_000000 The other day at someone's tea we met, Smiling gayly, bowed, and went our several ways, Complacent with successful coldness.--Yet
8555_292519_000011_000000 Suddenly I was back in the old days Before you felt we ought to drift apart. It was some trick-the way your eyebrows raise,
8555_292519_000012_000000 Your hands-some vivid trifle.
8555_292519_000012_000001 With a start Then I remembered how I lived alone, Writing bad poems and eating out my heart
8555_292519_000014_000000 VENICE
8555_292519_000015_000000 In a sunset glowing of crimson and gold, She lies, the glory of the world, A beached king's galley, whose sails are furled, Who is hung with tapestries rich and old.
8555_292519_000020_000000 And still the sensitive silhouettes Of the gondolas pass and leave no track, Light on the tides as lilies, and black In the rippling waters of long sunsets.
8555_292519_000022_000000 The pleasant graveyard of my soul With sentimental cypress trees And flowers is filled, that I may stroll In meditation, at my ease.
8555_292519_000025_000000 And ah! that moon of silver sheen! It is my heart hung in the sky; And no clouds ever float between The grave flowers and my heart on high.
8555_292519_000026_000000 I do not read upon each stone The name that once was carven there; I merely note new blossoms blown And breathe the perfume of the air.
8555_292519_000027_000000 Thus walk I through my wonderland While all the evening is atune, Beneath the cypress trees that stand Like candles to the barren moon.
8555_292519_000028_000000 TO WAR
8555_292519_000029_000000 The music beats, up the chasmed street, Then flares from around the curve; The cheers break out from the waving crowd: --Our soldiers march, superb! Over the track lined city street The young men, the grinning men, pass.
8555_292519_000031_000000 Another band beats down the street; Contending rhythms clash; New melodies win place, then fade, And the flashing legs move past. Down the cheering, grey paved street The fringed flags, the erect flags, pass.
8555_292519_000032_000000 CALM DAY, WITH ROLLERS
8555_292519_000033_000000 Always the ships that move in mystery, on the dim horizon, Shadow filled sails of dreams, sliding over the blue grey ocean, Far from the rock edged shore where willow green waves are rushing, And white foam people leap, to stand erect for the moment.
8555_292519_000035_000000 PHONOGRAPH-TANGO
8555_292519_000037_000001 He had got into her courtyard. She was alone that night. Through the black night rain, he sang to her window bars:
8555_292519_000039_000000 --That was but rustling of dripping plants in the dark. More tightly under his cloak, he clasped his guitar.
8555_292519_000041_000000 She was alone that night. He had broken into her courtyard. Above the gurgling gutters he heard- surely- a door unchained?
8555_292519_000043_000000 "A good old tune," she murmured --and I found we were dancing.
8555_292519_000045_000000 A little pagan child god plays Beyond the far horizon haze, And underneath the twilight trees He blows a bubble to the breeze, Which is borne upward in the night And makes the heavens shine with light. But soon it sinks to earth again, And, hitting hills, it bursts!
8555_292519_000045_000001 And then With foam the skies are splashed and sprayed; And that's how all the stars are made.
8555_292519_000046_000000 THRENODY
8555_292519_000047_000000 She is lain with high things and with low. She lies With shut eyes, Rocked in the eternal flow Of silence evermore.
8555_292519_000048_000000 Desperately immortal, she; She stands With wide hands Dim through the veil of eternity, Behind the supreme door.

908_157963_000026_000001 I see they lay helpless and naked: weeping And none to answer, none to cherish thee with mothers smiles.
908_157963_000029_000000 But he that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my head And kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast. And says; Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee And I have given thee a crown that none can take away. But how this is sweet maid, I know not, and I cannot know I ponder, and I cannot ponder; yet I live and love.
908_157963_000034_000000 She wandered in the land of clouds thro' valleys dark, listning Dolors and lamentations: waiting oft beside the dewy grave She stood in silence, listning to the voices of the ground, Till to her own grave plot she came, and there she sat down. And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit.
908_157963_000036_000000 Why a Tongue impress'd with honey from every wind? Why an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in? Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror trembling and affright Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy? Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?
